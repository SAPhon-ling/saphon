note: -parentheses mean that they were included in the phoneme chart, but it was mentioned that those sounds were mostly found in loans.
note: -the 1976 resource is a little different. It has ʎ and no l, dʒ or f (only in loans), but I went with what the 2007 source said since it is more recent (it mentions that ʎ has ɡone to dʒ).
