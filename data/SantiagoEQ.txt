note: [public]Phonemes /b/ and /d/ are found in Spanish loans, while /ɢ/ is probably a loan from a neiɡhborinɡ indigenous lanɡuaɡe. It appears in apparent loans for local fauna and flora. Mid vowels in this variety also appear to be borrowed.
note: [public]Alderetes does not distinguish /x/ and /χ/ as separate phonemes, but his description indicates that their distribution is not predicatable, suggesting that they are contrastive.
