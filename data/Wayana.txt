note: The choice of symbols for the back vowels in the inventory presented here is influenced by Tavares' (2006: 9) observation that “[t]he back vowels /u/ and /o/ are articulated with the lips unrounded. They are therefore different from the vowels found in English or French in which the lips are rounded and prominent.”
