Summary:	Julião (2005) is a work that mainly focuses on Anambé do Cairari  morphosyntax, and contains a brief phonology section, which draws mainly from the author's 1993 MA thesis (which is coded and discussed separately). Julião (2005) proposes underlying nasal consonants and contrastive nasal vowels for the languages and posits the following processes: (1) leftward LN, approximants /w, j, ɾ/ nasalize when preceding tautosyllabic nasal vowels (note that this LN process can be completely subsumed under the following GN process and it is not clear if the author intended these to be truly distinct processes); (2) a leftward nasal spreading process (p.54) which is triggered by the final nasal vowel of a morpheme and targets oral vowels and approximants /w, j, ɾ/. Voiceless consonants, /p, pʷ, t, tʃ, k, kʷ, h, ʔ/ are opaque, as is /ɾ/ (which is consequently both opaque and a target). /w/ nasalizes to [w̃] and /j/ is nasalizsd to [ɲ]. Significantly, this process is described as spreading at most three segments from the trigger, even when no opaque segments intervene to block the spread. We are correspondingly coding this as a GN process. (3) leftward LO, whereby /m, n/ optionally post-oralize to [mb, nd] when preceding an oral vowel (p. 50), yielding the following alternations: [m] ~ [mb], [n] ~ [nd]; (4) rightward XMP, wherby morphemes with initial voiceless obstruents pre-nasalize if the previous morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 58). The author describes this process as affecting voiceless stops,  but only provides examples for bilabials, so it is somewhat unclear whether this meant to apply to voiceless stops in general; (5) a rightward XMP process whereby morpheme-intial /k, kʷ, w, ɾ, j/ nasalize to [ŋ, ŋʷ, w̃, ɾ̃, ɲ] respectively  if the preceding morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 58).  Note that since processes (4) and (5), as exemplified in the work apply to non-overlapping sets of segments, we have taken these processes to affect different sets of consonants.  Note that the author appears to indicate in both the vowel phoneme table and presentationof the data that /ɔ/ does not have a nasal counterpart, and consequently neigher /ɔ̃/ nor [ɔ̃] has not been included in the phone inventory or processes.

Summary:	Miranda (2018) is coded here because we were unable to access the original source, Julião (1993), which is cited by this author. Citing Julião's (1993) phonemic inventory and data, Miranda posits underlying nasals /m, n, ŋ/ and contrastive nasal vowels /ĩ, ɨ̃, ẽ, ã, ũ/ alongside their oral counterparts (p. 90) as well as 1 phonological process: (1) leftward LDNH, triggered by the right-most nasal vowel of the root or the right-most nasal consonant of the domain (p. 138 - 139). Oral vowels and the approximants /j/ and /w/ are nasalized across the morpheme to [ɲ] and [w̃], respectively. Voiceless obstruents [p, t, k, ʔ], the glottal fricative [h], and the alveolar tap [ɾ] block this process.					
Notes:	/ɛ/ is probably an allophone of /e/, but unsure based on lack of description by Miranda.

Summary:	Baraúna & Picanço discuss nasality processes across TG languages. The authors posit underlying nasals for Anambé and propose one phonological processes, based on data from Julião (1993): (1) leftward LO, nasal consonants become post-oralized intervocalically (p. 152 - 153). Baraúna & Picanço also cite Julião's (1993) discussion of nasals become pre-nasalized and how that previous analysis is incorrect; the process proposed by Julião is actually the post-oralization process proposed by these authors.

Summary:	Citing data from Julião (1993), Baraúna proposes underlying nasal consonants and contrastive nasal vowels and also posits 2 phonological processes and 1 morphophonological process: (1) leftward LN, /j/ nasalizes to [ɲ] if it precedes a nasal vowel. The nasal vowel spreads leftward and triggers the nasalization of /j/ (p. 63); (2) leftward LO, nasal consonants post-oralize when preceding oral vowels (p. 69 - 73). This analysis seems to contradict the author's previous claim that /m, n/ pre-nasalize when preceding an oral vowel or word-initially; (3) rightward morphophonological alternation, consonants nasalize when preceded by a nasal vowel. Baraúna only notes one example of /kʷ/ nasalizes to [ŋw] word-initially in a morpheme: the root /kʷã/ 'hole' nasalizes to [ŋwã] when preceded by the morpheme [tʃĩ], resulting in [tʃĩŋwã] 'nose' (p. 64), and does not expand on whether this process applies for other words with word-initial obstruents or other consonants in Anambé do Cairari. Baraúna phrases the process as affecting word-initial {T}, and from previous data cited from Julião (2005), we know that /p, pʷ/ also nasalize, suggesting that this might be a natural class formed of /p, pʷ, kʷ/ that all undergo this same morphophonological process.					
Notes:	Author briefly discusses /m/ as having the allophone [m͈], a nasal with oral explosion; this has been included in the allophones section.   [ɾ̃] and [w̃] are listed as nasal allophones of /ɾ/ and /w/, but no description of any nasalization process is described.

Summary:	Julião (1993) is an MA thesis that serves as the basis for the phonology section of her 2005 PhD dissertation (which is summarized and coded separately). The overall description is quite similar in both this earlier work and the later work, but there is one notable difference: the author transcribes all vowels preceding ND consonants as nasal in the 1993 work, while this is not the case for the 2005 work.    Julião (1993) proposes underlying nasal consonants and contrastive nasal vowels for Anambé, and five process: (1) leftward LO, /m, n/ optionally post-oralize preceding an oral vowel, and according to author, nasals only undergo this process when they are in the onset of the final syllable (pp.44-47).  (2) BO, /m, n/ post-oralize word-initially when not followed by a nasal morpheme in the word; (3) leftward nasal spreading, triggered by a root-final nasal vowel, which targets approximants and vowels, and characterized as extending a maximum of three segments from the trigger. We consequently consider this a GN process. The segments {T, ʔ, h, ɾ} are opaque to to this process; (4) leftward LN, where the [mb, nd] allophones of /m, n/ from the previous LO process trigger nasalization of the preceding vowel; (5) rightward XMP, where morpheme-initial {pʷ, kʷ, w, ɾ} nasalize when immediately preceded by a heteromorphemic nasal vowel  (p.70).					
Notes:	"Pre-nasalized" allophones of underlying /N/ are most like post-oralized based on environment and have been included as such.

Synthesis:	Our synthesis of the published descriptions of Anambé phonology largely follows Julião's (2005) and (1993) descriptions, with a number of differences that we discuss below. We follow Julião in positing underlying /m, n, ŋ/, where /m, n/ optionally post-oralize to [mb, nd]. Our generalization about the distribution of the post-oralized allophones is slightly different, in that whereas Julião splits the distribution into word-intial and final-syllable onset positions (see relevant summaries), we generalize the position to simply being at the boundary between nasal and oral spans, as we discuss at greater length below. Similarly, we follow Julião in considering the language to have a leftward long-distance nasal spreading process from root-final nasal vowels that targets vowels and approximants. Since Julião describes this process as spreading only three segments to the left of the trigger, we consider this a GN process. However, we in addition posit a leftward LDNH process that affects only consonants, for which either nasal vowels or nasal consonants can be triggers.       Similarly, where as Julião appears to posit distinct LN process affecting approximants under the LDNH process affecting the same segments, and merging the two rightward nasalization processes that affect morpheme-initial consonants. The LDNH process is quite restricted, with approximants and vowels as the only undergoers, and all other segments (as well as flap) being blockers. LO triggers /m, n/ to be variably as post-oralized [mb, nd] before an oral vowel. MPP causes labial and velar stops as well as approximants to fully nasalize in some lexically-specified roots and suffixes when they attach after a root ending in a phonologically nasal vowel, and labial stops undergo a very simiar pre-nasalization process in the same morphophonological environment.  talk about r, n variation and why we've kept the deprecated name.
