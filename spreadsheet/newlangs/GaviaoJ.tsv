Summary:	Moore proposes underlying voiced obstruents (D), nasal consonants (N), and contrastive oral and nasal vowels (V, Ṽ) for Gavião do Jiparaná along with 9 phonological processes: (1) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of /p, t, k, b, d, ɡ/ to [mp, nt, ŋk, mb, nd, ŋɡ] following a nasal vowel word-final (p. 224); (2) BN, pre-nasalization of word-final /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋk] (224); (3) leftward LN, obligatory nasalization of /β/ to [β̃] before a nasal vowel (p.226); (4) leftward LN, optional nasalization of /β/ to [β̃] word-medially before a nasal vowel, resulting in the following variation: [β] ~ [β̃] (p. 226); (5) rightward LN, nasalization of /l/ to [l̃] after a nasal vowel (p.226); (6) circumdirectional LN, nasalization of /l/ to [l̃] word-medially between nasal vowels (p.226); (7) rightward LN, nasalization of morpheme final /p, t, k/ to [m, n, ŋ] between a nasal vowel and a following consonant (p.230); (8) rightward LN, morpheme-final /p, t, k/ nasalize to [β̃, n, ŋ] between a nasal vowel and another vowel (p.230); (9) bidirectional LDNH, nasal consonants and phonemically nasal vowels trigger bidirectional LDNH, nasalizing all oral vowels and /ɾ, j, l/ to [ɾ̃, j̃, l̃]. This process is blocked by voiceless and voiced obstruents (p.229).					
Notes:	Syntactic paper. Gavião do Jiparaná has five tones: low short, low long, rising short, falling long, and rising-falling long (p. 231).   Nasalization of /ɾ/: "The dental flap, r, is always voiced and occurs only word-medially. Some speakers have nasalized allophones of ɾ" (p. 226); the lack of description has been included as NA.   For the nasal harmony process below, the author does not provide any examples for the processs he proposes and therefore the domains are unknown, citing that the LDNH process may spread onto the next morpheme :under certani conditions which are difficult to summarize" (p. 229)  /s/ is used by the author for [ts].  It is stated that "all stops (except the glottal stop) are somewhat prenasalized word-medially following nasal vowels. The voiceless stops are strongly prenasalized word-finally" (P. 224). We are not certain if that means voiceless stops are strongly prenasalized word-finally following nasal vowels, or if that means voiceless stops are strongly prenasalized word-finally in an unconditional manner. We coded the process as BN.

Summary:	Moore proposes underlying nasal consonants (N )and oral vowels (V)  for Gavião. Contrastive nasal vowels are not listed in the phonemic inventory but are transcribed as such in the harmony processes and proposed by the author to trigger LDNH, therefore we consider Gavião to also have contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ). The author proposes 4 phonological processes: (1) leftward LN, optional nasalization of vowels in roots, approximants, and /β/ to [β̃]when adjacent to a nasal vowel nasal (p. 4); (2) rightward LDNH, root-internal nasal vowel or nasal consonants spreads their nasality rightward, nasalizing oral vowels and approximants within the root (p. 4). This process is blocked by any obstruent; (3) rightward XMP, the initial vowel of a vowel-initial morpheme is nasalized by a nasal vowel or nasal consonant that appears in the immediately preceding morpheme; (4) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋk] after a nasal vowel (p. 4).					
Notes:	Conference handout. No page numbers; page numbers are assumed. Two phonemic inventories are provided labelled "Non-Suruí" and "Suruí"; comparing the "Non-Suruí" inventory with the one in Moore's (1984) dissertation on Gavião, we assume that the Non-Suruí table provided pertains (at least in part) to Gavião.  Pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ → [mp, nt, ŋk] is not explicitedly described by the author but is transcribed in the data: ‘vulture’ mayakoo [mãj̃ãŋko:] and ‘strainer’ kãaliit [kã:l̃ĩ:nt] (p. 4). Given these examples, we have assumed a rightward LN process of /p, t, k/ → [mp, nt, ŋk] before a nasal vowel and have included it below.  The data point vãayaa [β̃ãːj̃aː] 'toad' (p. 4) seems to suggest that the LDNH process restricted to roots might be bidirectional.  Moore includes a process of final consonant lenition, in which /p, t, k, j, l/ nasalize to [β̃, n, ŋ, j̃, l̃], respectively, morpheme-finally preceded by a nasal vowel and followed by an oral vowel at a morpheme boundary. This process is coded below, under the XMP tag. Given that the allophones are a result of ordered rules, they have been coded as string mappings.

Synthesis:	We adopt the analysis presented by Moore at the 2017 Amazônicas conference in Manaus, supplemented by the phonological sketch in his (1984) dissertation. Following Moore, we assume underlying nasal consonants (N), oral vowels (V), and nasal vowels (Ṽ) for Gavião. We assume 4 phonological processes: (1) leftward LN, optional nasalization of vowels in roots, approximants, and /β/ to [β̃] when adjacent to a nasal vowel; (2) rightward LDNH, root-internal nasal vowel or nasal consonants spreads their nasality rightward, nasalizing oral vowels and approximants within the root. This process is blocked by any obstruent; (3) rightward XMP, the initial vowel of a vowel-initial morpheme is nasalized by a nasal vowel or nasal consonant that appears in the immediately preceding morpheme; (4) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋk] after a nasal vowel. The input-ouput mappings are included as the result of two ordered processes: morpheme-final consonant lenition, followed by rightward XMP.
