Summary:	Borges addresses two varieties of Avá-Canoeiro: Tocantins and Goiás, spoken in their respective states. The Tocantins variety is addressed in this section while the Goiás variety is included in its respective sheet. Nasal-oral alternations are identical across both varieties with the exception of (1) optional (post)-oralization of /m, n/ to [m~mb~b, n~nd~d] syllable-initially before an oral vowel, which is restricted to the Tocantins variety.  Borges proposes 4 phonological processes and 1 morphophonological process: (1) rightward LO, syllable-initial nasal consonants /m/ and /n/ are either post-oralized to [mb] and [nd] or oralized to [b] and [d], respectively. (p.83-84). According to the author, post-oralized nasals and voiced obstruents appear in conditioned free variation with each other; (2) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] before or after a nasal vowel. Borges notes that this process occurs mainly in stressed syllables (p. 85-86); (3) bidirectional LN, nasalization of glides /w, j/ to [w̃, j̃~ɲ] before or after a nasal vowel, primarily in stressed syllables. This process and the one before it have been separated based on the fact that the Borges claims nasalization of tap is optional; (4) leftward LN, /m, n, ŋ/ trigger nasalization of preceding oral vowels (p. 90-91); (5) Allomorpyof -pe, the final nasal vowel of a root triggers nasalization of the locative suffix {-pe} to {-m}  (p. 124-125).  For the nasalization of approximants, there are some forms within Borges' data that can't be derived using the LN rules the author proposes, which suggests that there might be an LDNH rule in Avá-Canoeiro that affects approximants and vowels; this possible rule is not addressed by Borges.					
Notes:	Avá-Canoeiro contains contrastive nasal vowels as well as oral vowels that can be nasalized. Borges notes that there are 22 speakers of Avá-Canoeiro and most of them live in the village of Canoanã (p. 20) in the state of Tocantins. The author cites Paiva's (1996) phonemic inventory, but proposes her own analysis.   Aspiration of voiceless stops in stressed syllables or word-initially seems to be optional (p. 81) and occurs in conditioned free variation with stops with schwa excrescence.   Borges notes that contrary to the other languages in Subgroup IV, Avá-Canoeiro does not contain the glottal stop [ʔ] in its phonemic inventory. For the allophones of /w/, [ɢʷ] is used in careful speech while [w] is used in fast speech (p. 87). Vowels are lengthened in stressed syllables.

Summary:	Couto e Silva proposes underlying nasal consonants (N), as well as contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) and oral vowels (V) that can be nasalized within certain environments for Avá-Canoeiro do Tocantins.   Couto e Silva posits 7 phonological processes: (1) boundary nasalization (BN), where /j/ is nasalized to [j̃] morpheme-finally before a consonant or word-finally "before silence" (p. 48); (2) bidirectional LN, where /j/ nasalizes to [n] in a 'nasal environment' (p. 48). From Silva's data, this LN process occurs whenever /j/ appears before or after a nasal vowel; (3) boundary oralization (BO), /m/ optionally oralizes to [w] "before silence" (p. 64); (4) leftward LN, oral vowels in a stressed syllable become nasalized "in a nasal environment" (p. 67); (5) bidirectional LN, nasalization of /j, w/ before or after a nasal vowel (p. 66). Different surface allophones for /j, w/ occur depending on generation of the speaker. Across all speakers of Avá-Canoeiro (those born pre-contact and born post-contact) /j/ nasalizes to [j̃] (p. 66). For speakers of Avá-Canoeiro born pre-contact (Faixa I and II, p. 66), /w/ nasalizes to either [w̃ʁ̃ʷ] or [w̃ŋʷ] and are in variation with each other, resulting in /w/ -->[w̃ʁ̃ʷ] ~ [w̃ŋʷ]. For speakers of Avá-Canoeiro born post-contact (Faixa III), /w/ only nasalizes to [w̃]; (6) leftward LN, optional deletion of root-final /m, ŋ/ root-finally. After this deletion, the feature remains as a floating [+nasal] feature which optionally nasalizes adjacent vowels and /ɾ, w, j/ (p. 64); (7) rightward LN, obstruents are nasalized when the previous morpheme ends in a nasal consonant or /j/ (p. 71). Couto e Silva provides the suffix {-katu, 'good'} which nasalizes to {-ŋatu} following /j/.					
Notes:	Couto e Silva's paper discusses the different realizations of phonemes across Avá-Canoeiro do Tocantins speakers, those born pre-contact and those born post-contact with Brazilians (p. 36). Speakers of Avá-Canoeiro Tocantins pre-contact are grouped into Faixa I and II, while those born post-contact are grouped into Faixa III. In their description, the author notes which consonant phoneme and allophones pertain to each group of speakers, but that differentiation is not included in the section on vowel allophony. Oral and nasal vowels have multiple allophones which Silva claims can either be in conditioned or unconditioned free variation. Given that it would be too difficult to individually code each phoneme, its allophones, and to which group of speakers each group of phones pertains to, consonant and vowel phones have been included as allophones in free variation of their respective phoneme. Transcriptions from the manuscript, while unclear to which group of speaker they pertain to (although they can be inferred following Couto e Silva's descriptions in the consonants section), are transcribed as being in "free variation" and support this decision, see: /watʃu/ 'veado' → [uːaːtʃʊ̥] ~ ['ˤwaːtʂʊ] (p. 41); /kaʁun/ '(fim de) tarde' → ['qˤaːʁʊ̃ːnɐ] ~ [qʰˤaːʁʊ̃ːn̥ɐ̥] ~ ['kaːʁʊ̃n] ~ ['kaːɣʊ̃nɪ] (p. 39).  Aspiration and pharyngealization (p. 63) are optional in stressed syllables. Vowels and their lengthened counterparts appear in conditioned free variation in stressed syllables.  Couto e Silva proposes a vocalism process of /p/ going to [ɨ] or [ə] before silence (p. 63); this process has been included in the allophones section despite there not being any examples that prove this process occurs in Avá-Canoeiro.   Couto e Silva proposes a process of optional obstruent nasalization morpheme-initially when the previous morpheme ends in a nasal consonant or the palatal approximant /j/ (p.71-72). We are skeptical of this process being an actual morphophonological alternation and suspect that this process may actually be restricted to lexically specified roots (as Silva only provides the example of /katu/ → [ŋatu] 'bom' (p. 71) which is proposed by other authors' analyses on Tupí-Guaraní languages to be part of a lexically-specified set of morphemes that undergo nasal alternation) in Avá-Canoeiro Tocantins rather than any root with a voiceless obstruent, as proposed by the author. However, due to the lack of further evidence from the author, we have included the process below as a morphophonological alternation for morpheme-initial voiceless obstruents.  In the same morphophonological process, Silva notes that "stop consonants can be nasalized" (p. 71), but only provides one example of this alternation: /katu/ → [ŋatu] 'bom' (p. 71). Despite the lack of transcribed data, the fact that Couto e Silva explicitedly claims that "stop consonants can be nasalized" (p. 71) leads us to assume that this applies to all voiceless obstruents in Avá-Canoeiro Tocantins. Therefore, we have extended the author's analysis and included the following segments as undergoers for this process: /p, t, k, kʷ/.

Summary:	This summary includes Paiva's (1996) manuscript on Avá-Canoeiro from Borges's citation of the same paper. We were unable to access the original source (Paiva, 1996) so the data and processes are coded from the secondary source; page numbers correspond to Borges (2006). Since the data and processes are cited from a secondary source, the information below may not completely reflect Paiva's original analysis.  Three phonological processes have been coded: rightward BO, /m/ and /n/ optionally become post-oralized word-initially (p. 83). This has been included based on Borges' own analysis that nasal consonants become post-oralized word-initially or word-medially and Borges' note that Paiva considers nasals to only become post-oralized word-initially (p. 83, footnote 112); (2) bidirectional LN, where /ɡ/ nasalizes to [ŋ] 'in a nasal environment syllable-medial or syllable-final' (p. 63, footnote 14). Borges does not provide any examples from Paiva's data to support this claim other than the footnote, so the process is assumed to be bidirectional, where /ɡ/ can either appear either preceding a nasal consonant or following a nasal consonant in the same syllable. There are no blockers or transparents for this process; (3) bidirectional LN, /j/ nasalizes to [j̃] in a 'nasal environment' (p. 85, footnote 114). Similar to the previous LN process for /ɡ/, there are no descriptions of environments provided for the nasalization of /j/; it is assumed that this is a local nasalization process and that /j/ nasalizes either when preceded by a nasal consonant or nasal vowel or when followed by a nasal consonant or nasal vowel. Based on Borges' note, Paiva's data applies to the Avá-Canoeiro dialect spoken in the state of Tocantins (p. 17).					
Notes:	Coding of LO is based on Borges' analysis of Paiva's data and footnote 112 (Borges, 2006, p. 83).   Borges notes that Paiva includes [ɨ] in the vowel inventory of Avá-Canoeiro but that Paiva later does not include it in the analysis section of vowels (p. 72), this vowel has been coded as part of the phonemic inventory.   Post-oralized stops were observed only word-initially (p. 83).   /p/ contains two allophones: [p] and [b], while /ɡ/ contains 3: [ɡ], [ŋ], and [ɢ]; Borges only specifies the environment for /g/ --> [ŋ] but does cite any other parts of Paiva's analysis for [b] and [ɢ] allophones (p. 52).					
Include in SAPhon:	Yes (tentatively; see comment above we are waiting on access to original source)

Synthesis	Our analysis differs from that of the above authors in the following ways: We assume a process of LO, whereby /m, n/ --> [mb, nd] before oral vowels, only in prosodically strong positions and for the Tocantins variety. We also assume a process of leftward LDNH affecting all vowels and sonorants. LDNH is not described fro Avá-Canoeiro, but both authors talk about local vowel nasalization and local sonorant nasalization processes. These local processes are insufficient to derive the long nasal spans present in the author's data, and looks very much like LDNH in Tapirape, as described by de Freitas Leite.  We assume LDNH to occur in the Tocantins variety of Avá-Canoeiro for the following reason: transcriptions in Borges' analysis for local nasalization processes result in in surface forms which cannot be derived solely from local rules, for example: /kujã/ → [qʊ̃'ɲə̃ː] ~ [qʊ̃'j̃ə̃ː] 'mulher', /o-jeŋ/ → [õ'ɲẽːŋə] ~ [õ'j̃ẽːŋə] 'ele está falando', /i-waŋ/ → [ɪ'w̃ə̃ːŋə] 'é vermelho', /kuɾum/ → [qʊ'ɾ̃ũːm] ~ [qʊ'ɾũːm] 'menino' (p. 85); /wama/ → ['w̃ə̃ːmə] 'pasto', /o-momew/ → [ˌõmõˈmeːw] 'ele conversou' (p. 90).
