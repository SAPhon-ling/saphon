Summary:	Copin proposes underlying Ṽ and N. The author proposes 1 phonological rule: (1) XMP LN of oral vowels when followed by a heteromorphemic "nasal syllable", i.e., a syllable with a nasal Ṽ as its nucleus. Copin posits that clitic boundaries are opaque to this XMP LN process.

Summary:	Grenand proposes underlying Ṽ and N. The author proposes 1 phonological rule: (1) local nasalization of /j, k/ to [ɲ,ŋ] when preceding a nasal Ṽ. Grenand notes that not all speakers nasalize in this environment, and adds that the distribution of speakers who do and don't present this alternation is not consistent with a particular geographic area. Rather, it seems that in every village, some speakers nasalize and others don't - for this reason we consider the processes to be optional. [ɲ,ŋ] do not occur in word-initial position, with the exception of the word [ɲã ~ jã] ''Brazil nut". The author also notes that glottal stop only occurs in the following environments: [VʔV] or [ṼʔṼ]. While Grenand does not note this, this empirical fact suggests that vowels nasalize across a glottal stop.

Summary:	Jensen's (1984) dissertation addresses two dialects of Wayampi, the Alto Jaria and Ampari dialects; this summary is for the Alto Jari dialect. Jensen proposes underlying Ṽ and N, and 4 phonological processes: (1) rightward LN where a root final nasal Ṽ nasalizes the initial voiceless stop T in the following morpheme; (2) nasalization of vowels in stressed syllabes, when they appear before morpheme-final N (which may or may not be word final); (3) optional post oralization of N before oral V; (4) nasalization of the prefix ɾ- to n- when preceded by the prefix pe-					
Notes:	There are two separate sections for the same paper in this sheet to represent two different wayampi dialects: (1) Wayampi do Alto Jari, (2) Wayampi do Ampari. They have small differences in inventory and in some phonological processes.

Summary:	Dos Santos proposes underlying Ṽ and N. The author proposes 3 phonological rules: (1) leftward nasal spreading, triggered by nasal Ṽ and N, targeting  V and approximants; (2) LN of obstruents (except for /t/, which does not become [n], and instead becomes [ɾ̃], whereas /ɾ/ becomes [n]) and LN of following vowel (when preceded by labials but not alveolars), also appears to be suffix initial obstruents but author does not specify; (3) optional LO of nasal consonants before oral v (not obligatory, more common in natural than careful speech).  The leftward nasal spreading process described by dos Santos is empirically rather messy: the extent of nasal sonorant spans to the left of the trigger seems to vary considerably in the data without this being due to the intervention of opaque segments and there are cases where spans of nasal consonants include within them no nasal vowels. The easiest way to interpret this body of data is that  this nasal spreading process in question is a GN process. 					
Notes:	Some of the nasality processes (ex. p.78) are listed as "not predictable", but these oral/nasal phoneme/allophone pairs all also are produced by real rules (ldnh, or the LN rule), so the "unpredictable" free variation is not written as a rule in the allophones. Nasal ə̃ is sometimes written as underlying in the data, but it is not described as a phoneme in the sections on nasal vowels and it appears to be an allophone of ã. The author notes that all six oral vowels can be nasalized (presumably as a result of LDNH), but there is surface neutralization of the height contrast for both central and back vowels. We suspect that this means that both /a, ɨ/ are realized as [ə̃], and that both /u, o/ are realized as [õ], though there is no explicit discussion of this anywhere. [ʔ] is not analyzed as a phoneme, and rather, as the result of suprasegmental processes (p. 50). A possible mo- nasalization process of the preceding CV is mentioned on page 78, but the prose is very non commital and not explicit about the rule, so it's not included in a section below. The LDNH process described above is supported by very limited amount of data, and there are an abundance of instances where it fails to apply. While we will code it as the author claims, the LDNH process will not be carried over to the synthesis.

Synthesis:	Our analysis is synthesized from multiple authors, from which we propose the following rules: (1) from dos Santos (2002) and Jensen (1984), optional post oralization of nasal N when preceding oral V; (2) from Jensen (1984), rightward LN triggered by nasal Ṽ which nasalizes the initial T in the following morpheme, which is combined with dos Santos (2002) to also include optional nasalization of the following vowel providing both options Ṽ+NV ~ Ṽ+NṼ; (3) from Jensen (1984), prefix ɾ- nasalizes to n when preceded by the morpheme pe- (historically nasalized); (4) leftward LN of the last vowel in the root, triggered by either a root-final N or an adjacent morpheme-initial N; (5) rightward LN triggered by suffix-initial /p/ that was nasalized to [m] by a root final nasal vowel (see LN:T), which then nasalizes the following vowel. While there is no discussion of inherently N-initial suffixes in any of the sources, we suspect that all N-initial suffixes trigger the rightward LN:Vsuffix process that nasalizes suffix vowels, whether the initial N of the suffix is derived via the LN:T process or is present in the underlying representation of the suffix. Copin (2012)'s single nasality rule is subsumed by the proposal of LDNH, and the same is true for the one nasality rule proposed by Grenand (1980). The allophones section is taken from dos Santos (2002) with the following modifications: (1) glides changed to include j, w alongside the originally proposed ɾ as in Jensen (1984); (2) from Jensen (1984), LN:T /t/ becomes n instead of ɾ̃ and LN:T /ɾ/ becomes ɾ̃ instead of n. We decided to not include the mentioning of LDNH processes since it is supported by very limited data and fails to surface under many expected environments.
