Data inputter:	Nicki Young					
Summary:	Rodrigues describes several local phonological processes: (1) LN, whereby oral vowels are nasalized when adjacent to {m, n}; (2) LO, whereby /m, n, ŋ/ are post-oralized before an oral vowel (categorical before a stressed vowel), (3) in FV with full nasals before an unstressed vowel; (4) LN, whereby /j/ is nasalized to [ɲ] before a nasal vowel (categorical before a stressed vowel, in FV with full nasals before an unstressed vowel); and (5) LDNH, whereby /m, n, j, ŋ/ always surface as fully nasal if they precede another nasal consonant or a nasal vowel in the word. Nasal contrast is phonemic only on stressed vowels. While the optionality of the oralization of the nasal vowel is not specified, we inferred from the data that it is optional. This process, however, is coded as LNSyll. 6) We are coding the leftward non-local nasalization of /j/ as LNSyll, although it is not a typical LNSyll process, since it may, according to the author, leave intervening oral vowels and/or consonants unaffected.					
Notes:	No explicit LDNH process is discussed, but in the discussion on the allophony between [N ~ ND], the author notes that [ND] only occurs before an oral vowel, when no other nasal vowel or consonant occurs in the word before the relevant /N/. In this way, LDNH, affecting only nasal consonants, can be inferred, insofar as only [N] is observed before [N/ND/~V]. Relatedly, oral vowels are said to be nasalized immediately before or after [m, n], which may be part of the same LDNH process, but LDNH for vowels is never discussed. Nasality is contrastive only on stressed vowels. We collapsed the enumeration of the allophones of /j/ in the following way: 1) a categorical nasalization into [ɲ] when it is immediately followed by an oral vowel, 2) an optional LDNH nasalization process into [j ~ ɲ] when there is a non-immeidate nasal vowel or consonant to the right. Note that this atypical LDNH has the nasal span of only a single segment. 3) a leftward LN process when it is preceded by a nasal vowel and followed by a nasal vowel, and 4) optional fortition into /ʒ/ when preceding an unstressed oral vowel.

Data inputter:	MJL, JL					
Summary:	This source is a pedagogical grammar for Tupinambá, and is therefore writen often using non-technical terminology. Lição 2 and Lição 3 provide a phonological description of several processes, including (1) cross morpheme LN of morpheme-initial /T/ --> [ND] after a nasal vowel; (2) Optional LO of /m, n/ to  [mb, nd] when they attach to another morpheme, where the initial vowel of that second morpheme bears stress; (3) /j/ is nasalized to [ɲ] before or after a nasal vowel; and (4) a process whereby a nasal phoneme lightly nasalizes "neighbouring" syllables. It is unclear on what this means about the extent and directionality of this nasalization. However, all the examples cited in the text are leftwards. The discussion of this process (p. 40) includes an example that demonstrates that this process is iterative, and that "neighboring" syllables need not be immediately adjacent to the trigger, in effect consituting a description of long distance nasal harmony. This leads us to characterize this process as LDNH, even though the author does not use these terms per se. 					
Notes:	The author does not provide a phonological inventory per se, but provides an alphabet and discussing "metaplasms"; that is, instances when letters are pronounced differently. I.e. the discussion at time provides clear evidence that a set of phones are in an allophonic relationship with each other, and in those cases, the alternations were listed in the allophones section. It is not necessarily the case, though, that the author actually believe that all the things listed as phonemes in the phoneme section for this source, were actually all distinct phonemes (e.g. /m/ and /mb/). We inferred from the data that there is a boundary oralization process targeting word initial nasals, not specific to morphemes.   Note: there seems to be some sort of boundary nasalization of word initial voiced stops (p. 28), but voiced stops are not phonemic in this language and seem to be purely orthographic idiosyncracies. Even though what's written as <b> superfically has the allophone [*mb], since we postulate that the <b> on page 28 is /β/ (O b intervocálico é debil, próximo de v), we decided that this "weak" <b> is not related to the <b> on the latter paragraphs of the same page. This is because the so called "boundary nasalization" covers all pre-nasalized segments, and there is no /d/ or /ɡ/ in the language.

Synthesis	Our synthesis is informed both by Rodrigues' (1958) analysis and by the generalizations and data presented in Lemos Barbosa (1956). (1) We infer the existence of a rightward GN process on the basis of the  LDNH:j processes we have coded for Rodrigues plus the LDNH process we have coded for Lemos Barbosa (1956); that is Rodrigues' leftward long-distance optional nasalization of /j/ plus Lemos Barbosa's LDNH process, summarized as "um fonema nasal nasaliza levemente as sílabas vizinhas." The maximal gradience of GN is coded as 2 because we have not found any nasal span longer than this in the data, although we cannot at this time rule out any longer span of this nature. Note that the fact that /N/ apparently never oralizes to [ND] when a nasal segment appears to its right is suggestive of the fact that even mild nasalization of the vowel immediately to the right of this phoneme is sufficient to prevent post-oralization. Also note that we believe that vowels nasalize in the GN nasal spans, even though Rodrigues basically mentions vowel nasalization only as part of the LN:VtoṼ process. Lemos Barbosa, however, does allude to nasalization of this type in the process we coded as LDNH for that source. Finally we have identified the undergoer class as sonorants, i.e., /V, j, ɾ, w/, even though neither author discusses nasalization of /w/. We assume that this is due to failure to transcribe the sound, rather than a natural-class violating exception. The nature of the GN process eclipses the categorical LNSyll:L process coded in Rodrigues, which will not be included in the synthesis. (2) We also analyze /β/ as being the underlying phoneme for orthographic <b>, doing away with a single voiced stop.					
Data inputter:	JL					
Date completed:	18/09/2024					
Notes:	It seems that Tupinambá exhibits classic leftward LDNH, where all voiced segments are undergoers and voiceless consonants are transparent. The evidence for approximants being undergoers is only partial, but we nonetheless consider the entire natural class of approximants being undergoers on the basis of evidence that the alveolar tap nasalizes to [n] (Lemos-Barbosa 1956, p. 40; [kũrũmĩ ~ kũnũmĩ]), and the fact that in TG LDNH more generally, the class of approximants behaves uniformly with respect to the LDNH process.  Following the reharvesting of the Rodrigues source by NY, JL updated the prose description of the synthesis to reflect our interpretation of the original German paper.

Prose description:	Suffix-initial or root-initial /p, β, t, k, s, ʃ/ are prenasalized to [mb, mb, nd, nɡ, nd, nd] in some lexically specified morphemes, after an immediately preceding nasal vowel. (This process, as described by Lemos Barbosa conflates a number of distinct morphological and/or morphophonological processes such as post-root nasalization of certain suffix-initial voiceless stops, and the nasalization of certain root-initial voiceless consonants following causative prefixes.
