Summary:	Armoye proposes both underlying nasals and prenasalized stops in the phonemic inventory. Furthermore, nasality may be contrastive in all vowels. Armoye proposes no processes pertinent to nasalization and analyses all surfacing instances of nasal vowels as phonemic. Consequently, there is no nasalization of vowels.

Summary:	Danielsen, Sell & Terhart propose underlying nasal V and m. They explicitly propose two phonological processes: (1) LDNH with stressed nasal V as triggers and unstressed oral V as undergoers; (2) LO of N to ND (presumably before oral vowels, which are referred to as "oral contexts", but no explicit environment is given). Furthermore, the morphemes listed in this sheet are described by authors as having nasal and oral allomorphs, where the oral allomorphs are said to surface in "oral environments" and the nasal allomorphs in "nasal environments" / "nasal contexts" (p. 15). The same is true for the nasal allophones in the allophone section that lack a specific proces in the sheet: "a voiceless stop p can change to mb, or k to ng, in a nasal environment of derivation, compounding, incorporation, or other ways that may change stems" (p. 15) and "approximant y ... which changes into ñ in nasal contexts." and also [ɾ̃]. Although phones [mp], [nt], and [ŋk] appear (in parentheses) in the phoneme table (Table 4, p.14) provided by the authors, they are otherwise not mentioned in the prose, nor is a process described for their realization.  The local oralization process seems to be optional, as the authors describe it as "vThe nasal consonants stand in a close relation to the seemingly prenasalized stops, which actually originate in nasals with a plosive offset coarticulation. Therefore we find allomorphs for the causative prefix as mbo- in oral, but mo- in nasal contexts. This can be transferred to many other parts of the language, i.e. a variation between m and mb (or n and nd) should not be taken as absolute realizations, but considered to be matter of variation on a continuum between orality and nasality." (p.15). Therefore, the Optionality row for this process has been labeled as "optional".					
Notes:	We analyzes the nominalization of verbs as a morpheme containing only a suprasegmental nasal feature. We also understand the prenasalization of /p, k/ as a part of morphophonological process (and not purely phonological) given the prose description (p. 15).

Synthesis:	This summary is mostly based on Danielsen's analysis. Though the analysis is often not detailed enough to fully understand the specific facts of Guarayu, all of the description and data suggest that Guarayu exhibits the same nasal-oral alternations that are frequently observed in TG languages. As such, while the details of the empirical facts are not fully clear, this summary is based on the available data, and our knowledge of the common typological patterns in TG, with which the available Guarayu data is fully compatible. Note that in the Urubichá variety of Guarayu, stress has generally shifted to the penult, without the position of contrastive nasal vowels shifting from the historical position of stress, i.e. final syllable. In Urubichá, then, it is no longer stressed nasal vowels that are contrastive,  but simply root-final nasal vowels.
