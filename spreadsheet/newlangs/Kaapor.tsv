Summary:	Kakumasu proposes underlying nasal consonants (N), complex nasal segments (ND), and contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) for Urubu Ka'apor.  Five phonological processes are posited: (1) leftward LO, optionally post-oralization of /m, n/ to [m~mb, n~nd] before an oral vowel (p.20); (2) rightward LN, nasalization of root-initial voiceless obstruents /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋk] following a nasal vowel in the preceding prefix (p. 3). There is no data to suggest that /k/ → [ŋk] however given Kakumasu's claim that this process affects voiceless stops, we assume that /k/ can also undergo this process; (3) leftward LDNH, root-final nasal vowels nasalize oral vowels root-internally (p. 25). Kakumasu's data only provides examples pointing towards /ʔ, s/ being transparent; (4) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of /j/ to [j] ~ [ɲ] preceding or following a nasal vowel (p. 22); (5) bidirectional LN, nasal consonants nasalize adjacent oral vowels. Kakumasu notes the following regarding this process "nasal consonants tend to nasalize vowels contiguous to it" (p. 25) and along with his data, this allows us to conclude that this process is bidirectional.					
Notes:	Kakumasu's notation has been updated to reflect current IPA: <s> for [ʃ] <y> for [j] <e, ẽ> for [ɛ, ɛ̃] <o, õ> for [ɔ, ɔ̃]  Devoiced vowels are indicated with the following diacritic [i̥]. Kakumasu describes the vowel devoicing rule as "adding frication a velar fricative [x]" in the case of the high vocoids /i, ɨ, u/. This fricative release is similar to Lucy Seki's (2000) proposal for high vowels in Kamayurá. Word-final vowel devoicing is transcribed by the author as a vowel as the following [iI]; we have adapted the following transcription to represent this process [i͡i̥].   Data for /k/ → [ŋk] is not provided by Kakumasu in the pre-nasalization of voiceless obstruents to [NT]s, but given the author's claim that this pre-nasalization occurs "between a nasalized vowel and voiceless stops" (p. 3), we assume that /k/ is part of the natural class of voiceless obstruents that undergo this process. It may also be the case that /kʷ/ undergoes this process of pre-nasalization as well.  Kakumasu includes two examples for his LDNH process, /heʔẽ/ → [hẽˡʔẽ] 'tired' and /risã/ → [rĩˡsã] 'cold' (p. 25), which show that /ʔ, s/ are transparent to nasal harmony. It is possible that all voiceless obstruents including /ʔ/ act as transparent, however Kakumasu does not explicitly state this information. His 1968 article does provide data that shows all voiceless obstruents (T) are transparent; this article and its analysis are included separately. He also says "it has been observed that a nasalized vowel occuring syllable finally tends to nasalize vowels preceeding it" implying optionality while data implies obligation - for this reason we have said we are uncertain about the optionality of this process.   There is a nasalization process that affects /j/ but the environment is unclear. Some examples suggest a local nasalization process, where a nasal vowel conditions the nasal alternant to its left. But other data appear to contradict this (see p. 20).

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Kakumasu proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) along with 5 phonological processes: (1) leftward LO, optional post-oralization of /m, n/ to [m~mb, n~nd] before an oral vowel (p. 4); (2) leftward LN, optional nasalization of /j/ to [ɲ] before a nasal consonant or nasal vowel (p. 5); (3) bidirectional LN, pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ to [mp, nd, ŋk] word-medially between two nasal vowels (p. 6); (4) rightward LN, nasalization of oral vowels following /m, n/ (p. 13-14). Kakumasu only provides examples for nasalization of root-final oral vowels. NDs block this process; (5) leftward LDNH, nasalization of oral vowels and /j/ preceding nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ/ or a nasal vowel. Voiceless obstruents (T) are transparent to this process (p. 14-15). 					
Notes:	Kakumasu's notation has been updated to reflect current IPA: /š/ → /ʃ/ /y/ → /j/ /tš/ → /tʃ/  /ŋ, ŋʷ/ have post-oralized allophones [ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ] however Kakumasu only mentions that their occurence appears in "normal speech" while "in fast speech [ŋ] and [ŋʷ] may be heard" (p. 4-5). No other description regarding their distribution is provided, so we consider this to be a case of free variation.   According to the data, [ŋ~ŋɡ] and [ŋʷ~ŋɡʷ] appear in the same environment as [m~mb, n~nd] which makes us consider that this LO process could be applied to all nasals.  Pre-nasalization of voiceless obstruents (T) is only briefly addressed in section 1.3.   For LDNH Kakumasu notes "Regressive nasalization may extend further than contiguous syllable but usage is variable and it has not been discussed in this paper." (p. 15). This suggests that nasaliation is gradient from the left edge of the word to the trigger.   Kakumasu notes that "It is possible to hear a phonetic difference between inherent nasalization and progressive nasalization when they occur syllable finally. For example, when a recorded tape is played backwards, the progressive nasalization is heard beginning orally and changing to a nasalized vowel before coming to the nasal." An inherently nasalized vowel begins nasalized." (p. 14). We understand it as coarticulatory nasalization instead of a spread of the [nasal] feature.

Summary:	Proposal for Ka'apor dictionary. Caldas proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) along with 4 phonological processes: (1) leftward LO, /m/ post-oralizes to [mb] preceding an oral vowel in a tautosyllabic stressed syllable (p. 36-37); (2) leftward LO, /n/ optionally post-oralizes preceding an oral vowel when it appears in a stressed syllable and syllable onset, resulting in [n~nd] variation (p. 35); (3) leftward LN, /j/ nasalizes to [ɲ] preceding a nasal vowel; (4) leftward LN, oral vowels are optionally nasalized "in a nasal environment" (p.42). Despite Caldas' claim that nasalization occurs "in a nasal environment", her transcriptions suggest that this process is leftward: /pi'nim/ → [pĩ'nim] ~ [pi'nim] 'pintado', /ʔɨm/ → [ʔɨ̃m] ~ [ʔɨm] 'não', /kamɨ/ → [kã'mɨ] 'leite' (p. 42).					
Notes:	<e> represents [ɛ] and <o> [ɔ] (p. 32). [tʃ~ʃ] only occurs in syllable onsets for borrowings from Portuguese (p. 38). Laryngealized vowels are marked with the following diacritic [ḭ].   Caldas notes the following about nasalized vowels in Urubu Ka'apor: "Todas as vogais podem ocorrer nasalizadas, com maior ou menor grau de nasalidade, quando em context nasal" (p. 42).

Summary:	Santos proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) for Urubu Ka'apor along with 2 phonological processes: (1) leftward LO, optional post-oralization of /m, n/ to [mb, nd] preceding an oral vowel in a stressed syllable (p. 42-43); (2) leftward LN, optional nasalization of /j/ to [ɲ] preceding a nasal vowel, resulting in the following variation [j] ~ [ɲ] (p. 51).  It is claimed that ŋʷ is only found before oral vowels but ŋʷ does participate in an allophonic alternation, which suggests that it is underlyingly /ŋʷ/, but that it exhibits a peculiar distributional restriction which is not entirely plausible (p. 42)

Synthesis:	We adopt Kakumasu's (1968) analysis of Urubu Ka'apor. Following this analysis, Urubu Ka'apor presents a series of 4 contrastive nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ/, as well as six vowels which contrast for their oral and nasal quality in word-final position. We note that we adopt Kakumasu's (1964) IPA transcription of the low front vowel /ɛ/ (rather than /æ/), which aligns with the other authors' transcriptions of this phoneme. We follow Kakumasu (1968) in assuming six, rather than five, contrastive nasal vowels.  We assume three crucial phonological processes resulting in oral-nasal alternations: (1) optional post-oralization of /m, n/ before an oral vowel [m~mb; n~nd]; (2) optional nasalization of vowels adjacent to nasal consonants; note that this results in surface variation of the kind [NṼ, NDV] from an underlying sequence /NV/; and (3) optional leftward LDNH triggered by contrastive, root-final nasal vowels, which can affect all classes of segments, including vowels, approximants /ɾ, j/, and obstruents /p, t, k/. Undergoing vowels must be in the syllable immediately preceding the trigger, resulting in a distinct LN process triggered by the root-final nasal vowels. In the case where LDNH does affect a preceding vowel, an intervening /p, t, k/ may pre-nasalize to [mp, nt, ŋk]. We assume that approximants /ɾ, j/ are always nasalized between two nasal vowels.  We consider LDNH to be optional based on the following reasoning: identical transcriptions of data show either completely nasal segments (suggesting LDNH can occur in Urubu Ka'apor) or oral vowels that have not been nasalized. For example: /risã/ → [rĩsã] (1964:25) or [risã] 'cold' (1968:5) and /heʔɔ̃/ → [hɛ̃ʔɔ̃] 'tired' (1964:25) or [hɛʔɔ̃] 'tired' (1964:25).  We assume nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] based on the following transcriptions provided by Kakumasu: [pĩɾũ] 'flatus' (1964:16), in which we consider the root-final nasal vowel to trigger the nasalization of the oral vowel in the previous syllable as well as nasalization of /ɾ/ despite the lack of transcription by the author. We also assume optional pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋk] is subsumed under this LDNH process based on data in Kakumasu's 1968 article: /hetũ/ → [hẽntũ] 'he smells', /iapũ/ → [iãmpũ] 'he is full (of food)' (1968:6), [piãpɛ̃] 'nail (finger) (1964:16), where /T/ pre-nasalization seems to only occur in words where LDNH takes place, i.e. between two nasal vowels. Due to inconsistencies in transcription, we also consider pre-nasalization to be optional based on these data points: [piãpɛ̃] 'nail (finger) (1964:16) and /pɨãpẽ/ → [pɨjãmpæ̃] 'nail (finger, toe)' (1964:2), which show that /p/ does not always pre-nasalize to [mp]. LDNH only affects the preceding syllable the trigger's location based on the following data: /wasakã/ → [wasãkã] 'paneiro' (1964:19) in which we can observe that, in a tri-syllabic word, only the final two syllables have nasal vowels, and the initial syllable seems unaffected by this process. Further data that suggests that the first syllable is not affected by LDNH and remains inherently oral are as follows: /iãkã/ → [ijãkã] 'his head', /iãpuĩ/ → [ijãmpuĩ] 'his nose', /pɨãpẽ/ → [pɨjãmpæ̃] 'nail (finger, toe)' (1964:2).  We assume /s/ and /ʔ/ are transparent based on the following examples: /risã/ → [rĩsã] 'cold' (1964:25) and /heʔɔ̃/ → [hɛ̃ʔɔ̃] 'tired' (1964:25).   In a /VN/ sequence, the output can be either [VDN] or [ṼN]. We believe that the leftward nasalization and the rightward oralization ultimately boil down to the same process that delineates the boundary of the oral/nasal span, and the two surfacing "allophones" are either due to the stochastic differences durnig spontaneous speeches or by the impressionistic judgement of the listener. Consequently, we coded two categorical and not optional processes: LN:L and LO, and notated the resulting allophones in the form of: {V, Ṽ, _N, LN}, {N, DN, V_, LO}. For instances of LN initiated by /ŋ, ŋʷ/, we code them as categorical in the allophone tuples, but we postulate that sometimes the nasalization is too weak to be perceptible, hence the remark of it being optional by some authors.
