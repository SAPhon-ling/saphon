Summary:	Villafañe proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and a four way contrast between oral, long oral, nasal, and long nasal vowels (grouped below under the labels V and Ṽ, respectively) for Yuqui. Four processes are posited: (1) rightward LN, root-final nasal vowels trigger nasalization of root-initial /ɾ/ to [n] in the following morpheme (p. 31); (2) rightward LN, suffix initial /ɾ/ nasalizes to [nd] when the previous root ends in a nasal vowel (p. 31); (3) leftward LDNH, a nasal vowel in a stressed syllable spreads its nasality leftward, nasalizing oral vowels. Based on Villafañe's transcriptions, /k, tʃ, s, ɾ/ are transparent to harmony; (4) leftward MPP, lexically specified nasal suffixes trigger nasalization of oral vowels of the previous root. This process is limited to oral vowels in the final syllable of the previous root and does not spread further (p. 31-32).					
Notes:	It seems like there's actually some kind of bidirectional LDNH, and the author describes this using one rightward and one leftward process (and the leftward process is caused by the blocking of the rightward one?). The 2014 paper is just some sections of the 2004 paper, copied verbatim - it can be easier to read for the nasality and allophones sections because of how it's formatted, but is missing some sections of the original.  Villafañe uses <y> to denote a "fricative sonora palatal central" (p. 18) and in her phonemic table (p. 14) groups it under the voiced fricatives which leads us to assume that this sound is /ʒ/.  Villafañe does not explicitly address which segments are transparent to nasal harmony, except to note that /ɾ/ is transparent to leftward nasal harmony, but the phonetic transcriptions allow us to infer the transparency of the segments /k, tʃ, ɾ, s/, which are listed below.  Only two suffixes are posited to trigger rightward MPP of oral vowels: {-nane, first} and {-mana, already} (p. 31-32). While we include them in the Morpheme IDs section below we also assume that this list is not exhaustive and other nasal suffixes can also trigger this process. Therefore, the trigger in the MPP block below is listed as "lexically specified nasal suffixes". Since the trigger for this process are certain nasal suffixes and because of the fact that Villafañe does not provide an exhaustive list, the environment for this process has been included as "&".

Data inputter:	Teela Huff					
Summary:	Gallinate proposes underlying N and Ṽ and (1) process of nasal shielding / LO of the dimunitive/intensifier -n to -dn. Nasal shielding is discussed, but no set conclusion is given - the two options proposed are (1) a possible split of /m/ to /m/ and /b/ to account for the sometimes-optional shielding involving some instances of Ṽb and (2) "strict" nasal shielding with /m~b/ as the underlying form.

Synthesis:	This synthesis adopts Villafañe's (2004) description of Yuqui. Following Villafañe, we assume underlying nasal consonants (N) and a four-way contrast between oral, nasal, long oral, and long nasal vowels for Yuqui and adopt the following processes: (1) leftward LN of root-initial /ɾ/ to [n] in a Root1-Root2 compound when the preceding root ends in a nasal vowel; (2) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of suffix-initial /ɾ/ to [nd] when the previous root ends in a nasal vowel; (3) leftward MPP, lexically specified suffixes trigger nasalization of oral vowels in the final syllable of the previous root. This process does not spread further than the final syllable; (3) leftward LDNH triggered by a nasal vowel, nasalizing all oral vowels. We assume /ɾ, t, tʃ, s, k/ to be transparent to harmony, following Villafañe's transcriptions: /gurakõ niã/ [gũɾãkõ niã] "sin fuerza", /yiti rõ/ [yĩtĩɾõ] "el niño sucio" (p.30) and /e-rasi-ã/ [ẽɾãsjã] "él está sano" (p. 31).  Based on Villafañe's transcriptions, we conclude that certain segments are opaque: /yibõ-ta/ [yiˡbõnta] 'cazará' (p. 22). This is based on the following reasoning: in a nasal harmony system, all segments need to fit in the following categories: targets, opaque, or transparents. Villafañe does not explicitly state which segments are opaque, but explicitedly posits that some segments are transparent (voiceless obstruents), some are triggers of nasal harmony (nasal vowels) while others are targets (oral vowels). This leads us to conclude that those segments that do no fall into these preceding categories are opaque. Note that direct evidence for the opacity of segments is weak in the data that Villafañe provides and in fact there is one apparent counter-example, i.e. /yibõ-da/ [yĩbõnda] "escuché que disparó" (p. 31). Which segments are opaque in Yuqui is an obvious question for futher research. Data from Villafañe also suggests that voiced obstruents do not appear to be targets of nasal harmony nor are nasalized stops conditioned by nasal vowels: /bũĩ/ [bwĩ] 'murciélago' and /boi/ [ˡboi̯] 'víbora' (p. 24).

Notes:	Only two suffixes are posited by Villafañe to trigger leftward MPP of oral vowels: {-nane, first} and {-mana, already} (p. 31-32). While we include them in the Morpheme IDs section below we also assume that this list is not exhaustive and other nasal suffixes can also trigger this process. Therefore, the trigger in the MPP block below is listed as "lexically specified nasal suffixes". Since the trigger for this process are certain nasal suffixes and because of the fact that Villafañe does not provide an exhaustive list, the environment for this process has been included as "&".
