Summary:	Rößler analyzes nasality alternations in Aché as mainly due to underlying nasal vowels, which trigger processes of local nasalization affecting voiced oral stops, and also identifies one local nasalization process where a root final nasal vowel causes the following suffix initial voiced stops to prenasalize (p. 55).  Rößler also identifies an optional process by which what she analyses as underlying voiced oral stops prenasalize either word intially, or when they occur between oral vowels. She explicitly states that Aché lacks long distance nasal harmony. Rößler analysis draws in part on that of Sammons (1977).   Rößler also makes some phonetic observations. These include: 1) that the nasal portion of [ND]s is very brief (p.45); 2) that the language may exhibit circum-oralized allophones (e.g., [bmb and dnd]), but that she was not able to collect clear enough acoustic data to definitively evaluate this hypothesis (p. 39, footnote 25; note that Spectrogram 6, which she provides in Annex 1 to support this idea, does not provide clear evidence one way or the other); and 3) the allophonic variation between {p,ɸ} is only observed in one dialect of Achê, the northern dialect.

Synthesis:	Our analysis draws heavily on Rößler's (2008) analysis, but we diverge from that work in our treatment of [D]~[ND]~[N] alternations. Whereas she treats /D/ as underlying, and derives [ND] and [N] phones from them via nasalization, we posit /N/ as underlying, and derive [ND] from /N/ via post-oralization, and /D/ via combined pre- and post-oralization.  We are motivated to do so because if one posits /D/ to underlie these alternations, it is difficult to account for the VmbV ~ VbV alternation in oral environments, as this would entail the underlying voiced oral stop gaining a nasal feature without there being any phonological or phonetic source for that feature (i.e., this would be case of spontaneous nasalization).  We thus posit underlying nasal consonants in cases of surface [m, mb, b]. We analyze the variability of [mb]~[b] both word-initially and in the onset of stressed syllables as a consequence of the phonetically variable strength of leftward oralization in these positions. One the other hand the categorical /VmV/ > [VbV] is due to the stronger leftward oralization in unstressed syllables.    We analyze these segments as the result of the interaction of two process: 1) leftward oralization; 2) rightward nasalization. Crucially, the strength of the leftward oralization process is: a) stochastic; and b) dependent on whether the vowel is in a prosodically strong position (i.e., word-initial or stressed syllable) or a weak position (i.e. unstressed, non-initial position): in strong position, the oralization process is weaker than in weak positions, a fact that one can attribute to greater faithfulness to the underlying nasal feature in the consonant in the onset of a strong syllable. The result is that: 1) #_V and V$'_V m > [mb] ~ [b], because the leftward oralization process is only sometimes strong enough to entirely wipe out the nasal feature of the the segment, while in the /'V$-mV/ environment, the consonant is not in a prosodically strong position, and the leftwad oralization process is thus strong, and therefore categorically eliminates the nasal feature from the underlying nasal consonant, i.e., /'V$-mV/ > ['V$-bV].   When an underlying nasal consonant is preceded by a nasal vowel, the interaction with leftward oralization yields two different results. When leftward oralization is weak, i.e, the nasal consonant is in the onset of a strong syllable /v'$NV/, then the nasal vowel reinforces the nasality at the left edge of the nasal consonant, so that the weak leftward oralization process is insufficient to wipe out the nasality entirely, resulting categorically in surface [vmbV]. When the nasal consonant is in the onset of a weak syllable /'v$NV/, leftward oralization is strong, meaning that the oralization process can sometimes entirely wipe out the nasalization of the segment, resulting in variable ['vmbV] ~ ['vbV].   This language does not exhibit LDNH: all nasalization processes are strictly local. Vowels also contrast in nasality in all positions of the word. /N/s (post-oralize) when adjacent to oral vowels. Root-final nasal vowels cause prenasalization of /D/-initial suffixes (note: I'm not sure how to account for the face that suffixes have contrastive voiced stops--which makes me wonder if I should just wholly adopt Rößler's /D/ analysis throughout).

Notes:	The nasalization process in Sammons has been generalized from /b/ to other places of articulations of obstruents, but it is not entirely clear if it is correct to extrapolate in such a way given the lack of a velar nasal.
