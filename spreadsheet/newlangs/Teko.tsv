Summary:	Describes morphemes as having a nasal suprasegmental feature attached to the right side of a morpheme that can spread, and other morphemes that are capable or incapable of being affected by that spread. This is seen in the proposal of 1) LDNH where all voiced non-continuants are nasalized in a root with a suprasegmental nasal feature. Also proposed is 2) a local nasalization process by which vowels are optionally nasalized before [mb, nd]; 3) optional spontaneous nasalization where /b, d/ become [mb, nd] intervocalically; 4) a morphophonological process by which suffixes and some lexically specified prefixes are realized as nasal when attached to a root with a suprasegmental nasal feature.					
Notes:	Nasality is not described as an underlying feature of segments, rather it is an underlying feature of morphemes. Rather than positing that there are underlying vowel phonemes, Francoise posits that there is solely an undering supersegment that spreads through the entire morpeheme. List of affixes which may be realized as nasal seems to be non-exhaustive. Nasality is said to be underlying autosegmental feature assigned to morphemes that triggers LDNH. Analysis not directly proposed rather a description of possibility quoting other analyses. Vowels are not directly transcribed as nasalized, but the author claims that they are likely and future research will be done to check. LDM: The author treats the application of phonological rules, in particular LDNH, resulting in alternations in the form of particular morphemes as instances of allomorphy. This diverges from our use of these terms, where we understand the morpheme-specific application of phonological rules to be instances of morphonological processes, and not instances of allomorphy per se.

Summary:	Rose adjusts their analysis of nasality a bit from that of 2000-2003. In this paper they adopt an analysis 1) LDNH that spreads either from the final nasal vowel or fully nasal stop in a word, or spreading from the rightmost /mb, nd/. These fully nasal stops come from 2) BN where voiced stops fully nasalize word finally. This differs slightly from the previous analysis. Also proposed is 3) A morphophonological local syllabic nasalization of some lesically specified suffixes and prefixes; 4) a claim that /b, d/ a realized as [mb, nd] intervocalically, which we must classify as spontaneous nasalization; and 5) optional spontaneous nasalization of /b, d/ to [mb, nd] at the beginning of a word.					
Notes:	List of affixes which may be realized as nasal seems to be non-exhaustive. LDM: The author treats the application of phonological rules, in particular LDNH, resulting in alternations in the form of particular morphemes as instances of allomorphy.

Synthesis:	Émérillon exhibits allophony between /N/ and postoralized [ND, D], where N appears in a nasal span, ND appears at the boundary between a nasal and oral span, and D may optionally appear morpheme-initially preceding an oral vowel. We posit fully nasal stops as the underlying form. Émérillon exhibits LDNH, triggered by contrastive nasal vowels or consonants. LDNH in this language is not as productive in prefixes as in other TG languages, where only two prefixes are attested as possible undergoers, and prefix-prefix boundaries are opaque. A small number of suffixes are also undergoers of LDNH when they attach to a root ending in a contrastive nasal vowel. These are represented here by 1) leftward root-interal LDNH triggered by a root final nasal vowel or rightmost nasal consonant; 2) LO whereby /m,n/ are post-oralized and /ɲ/ is fully oralized preceding an oral vowel; 3) LO whereby /m, n/ are optionally fully oralized morpheme-initially; 4) MPP local syllabic nasalization whereby certain lexically specified prefixes undergo LDNH when attached to a nasal root; 5) MPP local syllabic nasalization whereby certain lexically specified suffixes undergo LDNH when attached to a nasal root					
Data inputter:	MJL, EK					
Date completed:	2022/8/23					
Notes:	When the final syllable of a root exhibits a coda nasal, the preceding vowel is necessarily nasal. In such cases, either the nasal consonant or nasal vowel (or both) could be treated as being present underlyingly, and as being the relevant trigger of leftward LDNH--it isn't possible to tease apart which of the two segments is actually triggering the nasal spreading.
