Summary:	Moore, Facundes & Pires posit a 3-way contrast between nasal consonants (N), pre-nasalized stops (ND), and voiced oral stops (D) for Nheengatú spoken in the Upper Rio Negro (p. 93, 98). The authors only posit oral vowels (V), claiming that "there are only four vowel phonemes in modern Nheengatu, at least in the dialect studied. Nineteenth century sources often note a fifth vowel, presumably ɨ" (p. 100).  Moore et al. propose 2 phonological process: (1) leftward LN, the nasal portion of a pre-nasalized stop nasalizes preceding vowels in a morpheme or across morphemes (p. 98); (2) bidirectional LN, vowels are nasalized either preceding or following /j̃/ (p. 99). There are no transparents or blockers for this process. The authors note that the consonants /m, n/ both occur before or after oral or nasal vowels (p. 99).					
Notes:	There is occasional free variation between /t/ and /tʃ/ before [i] but not in all cases.   "The palatal nasal is analyzed here as (the typically Tupian) ỹ instead of ñ because (1) it is usually a glide phonetically and (2) the vowels on either side are obligatorily nasalized, unlike the cases of nasals m and n" (p. 99, authors' emphasis). Because of this claim <ỹ> has been included as /j̃/ in the natural classes and allophone rows.  This description pertains to the Upper Rio Negro variety of Nheengatú, as noted by the authors: "On this basis we present a very brief description of some of the main structural features of the contemporary Nheengatu of the upper Rio Negro, noting obvious resemblances to the structure of its indigenous ancestor or to Portuguese. Unfortunately, no information is yet available on the Nheengatu of other regions and so little can be said about the important question of variation within modern Nheengatu -- which may be considerable" (p. 93).   Historically, /ŋ/ existed in Tupinambá and triggered nasalization of the previous vowel but disappeared in Nheengatu (p. 100).   <č> is assumed to be /tʃ/ and <š> /ʃ/.

Summary:	Borges proposes a phonemic inventory of Nheengatú spoken in the Rio Negro that includes phonemes from Nheengatú and those borrowed from Portuguese; all phonemes and their allophones have been included below.   Borges proposes underlying nasals (N), contrastive nasal vowels (Ṽ) and oral vowels (V), and posits 6 phonological processes: (1) bidirectional LN, where /j/ and /w/ nasalize 'in a nasal environment' (p. 65 - 66). Based on Borges' data, this process is bidirectional and triggered by a nasal vowel that either precedes or follows the glides {w, j}. /j/ either nasalizes to [j̃] or [ɲ] while /w/ nasalizes to [w̃] (p. 65); (2) rightward LN, optional nasalization of stressed oral vowels word-finally before /N/ (p.66). The nasalized vowels are in free variation with their oral counterparts, hence why they optionally nasalize; (3) leftward LN, obligatory nasalization of stressed nasal vowels when preceded by a nasal consonant (p. 83-84); (4) leftward LN, oral vowels in unstressed syllables nasalized when followed by a nasal coda (p. 84); (5) circumdirectional LN, optional nasalization of unstressed vowels when between two nasal consonants (p.85-86); (6) leftward LDNH, vowels and glides /w, j/ are nasalized in the environment of a nasal vowel.					
Notes:	[f, x, l, v, z, ʒ] are borrowings from Portuguese (p. 69).   <O> is probably /ɔ/ based on Borges' description that it is an open mid-back rounded vowel (p. 32); <A> is probably /ə/ given Borges' table of oral vowels (p. 32) that describes a open-mid central unrouded vowel and <E> is considered to be [ɛ]. Some vowel allophones of nasal vowels are in unconditioned free variation with each other.   The LDNH process described below appears to be blocked by any consonant other than the glides /w,j/, given the patterns evident in the data, but the author does not explicitly discuss these opacity facts. Therefore, they have been excluded from the LDNH process below.

Summary:	da Cruz proposes underlying N and contrastive nasal vowels for Nheengatú as well as 2 phonological processes: (1) rightward LN, voiced stops pre-nasalize after a nasal vowel (p.46-49); (2) leftward LN, /i/ glides to [j] in syllable onsets and then nasalizes to [ɲ] when preceding a nasal vowel (p. 61).					
Notes:	Voiced and voiceless obstruents are neutralized following a nasal vowel (p. 38); da Cruz's data represents these obstruents with the archiphonemes /P, T, K/ for this process. da Cruz does not consider /kʷ/ or /ʔ/ to be phonemes in Nheengatú, but rather that /kʷ/ is a sequence of <ku>. The author mentions a process of oral vowels nasalizing before a nasal consonant (p.59) but does not propose any data for it or expand on its analysis.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Taylor posits underlying nasal consonants (N), pre-nasalized stops (ND), and contrastive oral (V) and nasal vowels (Ṽ) for Nheengatú, and 1 morphological and 1 phonological process: (1) rightward allomorphy selection, the locative suffix {-pe} nasalizes to {me} following a nasal vowel of the previous morpheme (p. 5, footnote 6); (2) rightward LN, stressed oral vowels nasalize following nasal consonants (p. 5).					
Notes:	The phonemic inventory and harmony processes in this paper only apply to the Rio Negro variety of Nheengatú. Pre-nasalized stops /mb/ and /nd/ are conserved in the Rio Negro variant of Nheengatú, but are reduced to /m/ and /n/ in the Maué variant (p. 3).   For the morphological process below, Taylor notes that "uma vogal nasal pode nasalizar a consoante inicial do sufixo locativo -pe: paranáme (//paraná-pe//; author's emphasis) "no río", atestado em Tapuruquara e no Içana" (p. 5). While the use of "pode" suggests that this process may be optional in the Rio Negro variety of Nheengatú, since no further explicit analysis by the author is provided, Optionality has been included as N/A.  Taylor uses <š> to denote a palatal sibilant, which has been interpreted as /ʃ/ (p. 6).   There are no page numbers in this manuscript; page numbers are assumed.

Synthesis:	This synthesis relies on processes from multiple authors: LDNH and LN from Borges and ONAllm from Taylor, also supplemented with material from all of the authors above. The phonemic inventory is taken from da Cruz and Moore et al. and the phonemes [f, v, x, l, z, ʒ] which Borges considered borrowings from Portuguese. We assume underlying oral and nasal vowels and underlying /N, ND, D/, where /D/ is restricted to [b, ɡ] and very infrequent. Note that Moore et al. and da Cruz differ in their analysis of surface [ND]s, with Moore et al. positing them as underlying (like the other authors who have described this variety), and da Cruz deriving them via nasalization of [D]s by preceding nasal vowels. We assume that vowels are nasalized before or after a nasal consonant. Following da Cruz & Moore et al., vowels are always nasalized before an [ND], and we suspect that the optionally discussed by Borges may be due to variation in perception rather than variation in articulatory implementation of vowel nasalization (e.g. it seems very unlikely that a vowel between two nasal consonants is variably realized as oral, and much more likely that that vowel simply doesn't sound nasal at time because of perceptual filtering of the effects of the adjacent nasal consonants). We note a rather restricted process of leftward LDNH, triggered by root-final nasal vowels and affecting only {V, w, j} and blocked by all other intervening segments except glottal stop. We assume a morphophonological alternation of the locative suffix {-pe} to {-me} when following a root-final nasal vowel.

Notes:	Moore et al. do not explicitedly propose LDNH but one data point [ỹãʔã] 'that' (p. 99) seems to suggest LDNH is possible in Nheengatú. Based on Borges' analysis, we consider a restricted case of LDNH to occur in Nheengatú, which affects only /V, w, j/, and is blocked by all segments but /ʔ/, which is itself transparent. We consider /kʷ/ to be a phoneme in Nheengatú, along the same analysis as Moore et al and Taylor, and not a sequence of <ku> as proposed by da Cruz.
