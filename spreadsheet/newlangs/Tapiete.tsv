Summary:	This summary combines González's (2005) doctoral dissertation and her (2008) article, given their similarity in analysis. Her 2008 article is a Spanish translation of sections from her dissertation, therefore, page numbers have only been included for the 2005 source.  González proposes underlying pre-nasalized consonants (ND) and contrastive oral (V) and nasal vowels (Ṽ) for Tapiete, along with 6 processes: (1) leftward LDNH triggered by the penultimate stressed nasal syllable of a lexical root. This process nasalizes all oral vowels and pre-nasalizes obstruents /p, t, k, tʃ, dʒ, ʃ, s/ to [NT]/[NS]. Underlying /ND/ surface as nasal stops [N] (p. 68); (2) rightward LN, variable nasalization of /ɾ/ followinɡ a nasal vowel, resultinɡ in /ɾ/ surfacinɡ as either [ɾ̃] or [n] (p. 60); (3) rightward LDNH triggered by a stressed nasal syllable of a lexical root, nasalizing all oral vowels. /p, t, k, dʒ, ʃ, s/ pre-nasalize to [mp, nt, ŋk~ntʃ, ndʒ, nʃ], respectively, and then block nasal harmony from further spreading. The following segments act as transparents: /ɾ, w, h, ʔ/ (p. 69, 86-87); (4) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of obstruents /p, t, k/ and fricatives/affricates /s, ʃ, dʒ/ to [mp, nt, ŋk, ns, nʃ, ndʒ] following a nasal vowel (p. 66-67); (5) leftward LO, optional oralization of nasal vowels before voiceless obstruents; (6) rightward MPP, the causative suffix /mbɨ/ triggers pre-nasalization of following root-initial obstruents, e.g. <kɨrɨ> 'to be ticklish' → <ha'e mɨ-nɡɨnɨ> 'he tickled him/her' (p. 88). In this process, /tʃ/ pre-nasalizes and voices to [ndʒ], (135) <ai-che> 'I enter' → <mɨ-nye> '(s)he puts inside (lit. (s)he makes (it) go inside) (p. 88), while /s/ surfaces as [nd]: <soso> 'pierce' → <nde mɨ-ndoso> 'you cut' (p. 88).					
Notes:	Regarding the status of nasal consonants in Tapiete, González considers them "allophones of pre-nasal voiced stops and voiceless stops. Nasal consonants are found in nasal environments, pre-nasal voiced stops and voiceless stops are found in oral contexts" (2005:64).  González's description of triggers in nasal harmony processes is at times unclear. In some sections she considers the trigger to be the "nasal syllable" (2005:68), but in other processes she describes the trigger as segments which make up those nasal syllables, i.e. a nasal vowel or a nasal consonant (2005:68), such that it is not entirely clear what the author considers to trigger nasal harmony in Tapiete. We have included González's analysis to the best of our understanding and as detailed as possible within the constraints of our database. Based on her proposals and transcriptions, we include both prose descriptions which reference the "nasal syllable" and nasal vowels/consonants that also trigger long distance nasal harmony processes.  While the majority of obstruents and fricatives undergo obligatory pre-nasalization, i.e. /T/ to [NT], following a nasal vowel, pre-nasalization of /ʃ/ exhibits variation (and seems to be optional), based on the following claim from the author: "However, the articulation of the homorganic nasal consonant preceding the palatal voiceless fricative [ʃ] is much more unstable. Thus, it is common to find a fully nasal vowel in this context, as shown in (74) → /mĩʃi/ → [mĩʃi] 'small'" (2005:67). Example (73), higher above on the same page, supports this optionality:  /mĩʃi/ → [minʃi] 'small'. This variation has been indicated as {ʃ, nʃ} in the allophones below.  The data presented by González for variable nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] ~ [n] actually seems to be part of a rightward LDNH process: /hãɾa/ → [hãnã] ~ [hãɾ̃ã] 'that's why', /ĩɾu/ → [ĩnũ] ~ [ĩɾ̃ũ] 'other' (p. 60). This data contradicts González's later claim that tap is transparent to rightward nasal harmony (p. 69) and suggests that /ɾ/ is also an undergoer for LDNH.  In her MPP process González notes that this alternation is "limited to the verbal roots given in the precedent examples (examples 128-136, p. 87-88). Therefore, the rule responsible for the spread of nasalization in this context appears as non-productive, since it only applies to a limited set of verbal roots" (p. 88-89). Given this explicit claim by the author, only those morphemes have been included as undergoers in this MPP block. The examples for this process are transcribed by the author in her tentative orthography for Tapiete; they have been left in the orthography in the summary above but have been adapted to corresponding IPA in order in the repective process block to fully represent González's exact analysis. González notes that this process "mainly affects lexical roots whose first segment is a voiceless velar stop [k], which becomes a prenasalized voiced stop [ŋɡ]" (p. 87). Given that earlier she also addresses all voiceless obstruents as undergoers, we include /p, t/ as undergoers as well.

Synthesis:	The synthesis presented here is grounded in González's (2005) descriptive generalizations, but is informed by our comparative understanding of nasal segment alternations and harmony processes in the family. We follow González in treating Tapiete as having contrastive oral (V) and nasal vowels (Ṽ), and the following phonological processes: (1) rightward LN, consisting of the variable nasalization of /ɾ/ to either [ɾ̃] or [n] followinɡ a nasal vowel; (2) rightward LN, consisting of the pre-nasalization of /p, t, k, s, ʃ, dʒ/ after a nasal vowel, and resulting in the following surface [NT]s: [mp, nt, ŋk, ns, nʃ, ndʒ];  (3) rightward MPP, where the causative prefix triggers post-oralization of root-initial /p, t, k, kʷ, tʃ, s/, resulting in surface [ND] i.e. [mb, nd, ŋɡ, nɡʷ, ndʒ, nd]. We follow González in treating this process is restricted to a series of specific roots in Tapiete, specifically: /kɨdʒe/ 'to fear', /kʷaɾu/ 'to urinate', /kɨɾɨ/ 'to be ticklish', /kaɾu/ 'to eat', /kʷeɾa/ 'to cure', /kɨʔa/ 'dirty', /kuʔi/ 'ground', /tʃe/ 'to sleep', /tʃe/ 'to enter', /soso/ 'to pierce'.  We differ from González in the a number of ways. First, given that González' data and analytical generalizations are consistent with fully nasal consonants (N) appearing before nasal vowels (Ṽ), and complex nasal stops (ND) appearing before oral ones, we adopt the analysis, more widely appropriate in TG languages, that nasal consonants (N) are phonemic in Tapiete, with [ND] surfacing as their post-oralized allophones before oral vowels. The following data support this conclusion: [mbeɾu] 'fly', [kambu] 'to breastfeed', [nde] 'you', [hendu] '(s)he listens' (p. 46). Second, although we follow González in positing a leftward LDNH process, we do not follow González in positing a rightward LDNH process. This is for two reasons: 1) comparative analysis of LDNH in TG languages reveals very few (if any) compelling cases of rightward LDNH; and 2) all the putative instances of rightward LDNH in González's Tapiete data, can be accounted for by simply assuming that the nasal vowel that triggers the LDNH process is actually the rightmost one (often, but not always, root-final), and that the only operative LDNH process is leftward. It is important to note that González' adoption of a rightward LDNH process in Tapiete appears to have been motivated by widespread analytical assumption that only stressed syllables are loci for nasal harmony triggers. However, it does not appear that the requirement that nasal harmony triggers occur in stressed syllables is univeral in TG languages, and here we consider that nasal harmony triggers may occur in either stressed or unstressed syllables. Doing so for Tapiete allows us to simply posit a single leftward LDNH process that is triggered by either the rightmost nasal vowel or a nasal consonant in the nasal harmony span, which, nasalizing all segments to its left. We include /w/ as an undergoer for the LDNH process, despite this segment not being transcribe as nasal within nasal harmony spans, due to sonorants otherwise as a class being a target for nasal harmony. The following segments are transparent to leftward nasal harmony: /p, t, k, kʷ, tʃ, dʒ, s, ʃ, h, m, n, ŋ/ and there are no opaque segments. Third, we take González' description of /p, t, k, dʒ/ and the fricatives /s, ʃ/ undergoing pre-nasalization within nasal spans, as a manifestation of the rightward LN process discussed above, where the vowel nasalized by the leftward LDNH process results in the prenasalization of the consonant to its right. However, unlike González, we do not find it plausible that the vowel that produces this excrescent nasal subsequently optionally oralizes. We suspect that in these cases, the percept of nasalization is less obvious, but the vowel is no less (or more) nasal than any other vowel in a comparable position in the nasal harmony span. Finally, because we treat nasal consonants as phonemic in Tapiete, we take the causative prefix's underlying form to be /mɨ/ and not /mbɨ/. Even when the [mbɨ] allomorph surfaces, however, it still triggers pre-nasalization of the following root-initial undergoer for the relevant affected roots.

Notes:	González does not indicate that Tapiete exhibits any nasal-oral alternations at suffix boundaries.  Following González we assume that pre-nasalization of /ʃ/ to [nʃ] exhibits variation.
