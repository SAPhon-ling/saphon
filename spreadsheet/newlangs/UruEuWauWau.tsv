Summary:	Netto & de Moraes propose underlying N and contrastive nasal vowels for Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and 2 phonological process: (1) leftward optional (post)-oralization of {m, n} at the beginning of a word before an oral vowel, resulting in variation [m~mb~b] and [n~nd~d], respectively (p.9). The authors denote these allophones as pre-nasalized but they seem to be post-oralized allophones of {m, n} (p.8-11); (2) leftward LO, variable post-oralization of /m, n/ word-medially before an oral vowel, in tonic or pretonic syllable, resulting in [m~mb] and [n~nd] variation (p.10). Netto & de Moraes note that [b] only occurs in 5 tokens, while [d] only occurs in 2 tokens from their data. Neither /ɲ/ nor /ŋ/ undergo this LO process as the authors claim that /ɲ/ and /j/ are separate phonemes and that /k/ voices to [ɡ] preceding /a/; and [ŋw] is analyzed as an allophone of /w/; they have therefore been excluded from the coded process.					
Notes:	Netto & de Moraes consider 2 dialects of Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau: Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and Mondawá. The authors group their data into the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau language and do not distinguish any specific processes or other facts that might differentiate between the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and Mondawá dialects. There are no page numbers; page numbers are assumed.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	dos Santos et al. propose underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive nasal vowels for Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, along with 3 phonological process and 1 morphophonological process: (1) leftward LDNH, the right-most nasal vowel spreads and nasalizes oral vowels and approximants across a root. The authors only provide two examples for this process, one of them which shows that {h} is transparent to this process (p.10-11). Given that dos Santos et al. describe this process as affecting vowel-to-vowel, along with the fact that /h/ is shown as transparent in the transcribed data, we assume that all obstruents are transparent to this process. dos Santos also explicitly says that all obstruents (except glottal stop) are transparent to nasal harmony in a later paper; (2) leftward LO, nasal consonants post-oralize before an oral vowel (p.12-13); (3) leftward LN, the nasal portion of an ND spreads leftward and nasalizes the preceding vowel (p.12-13); (4) rightward XMP, certain morphemes (either roots or suffixes) with initial vowels or voiceless obstruents {p, t, k} nasalize or post-oralize, respectively, when the previous morpheme (either a prefix or root) ends in a nasal consonant or nasal vowel (p.11-12).					
Notes:	Regarding the LO process and the environment where [ND]s appear, the authors note the following: "Aparentemente, a regra de que uma consoante nasal ou nasal pós-oralizada se realiza antes de uma vogal nasal ou oral, respectivamente, é válida somente para sílabas tônicas" (p.13). We interpret this as meaning that there is no such restriction in non-stressed syllables, where [N]s and [ND]s may appear with before both oral or nasal vowels.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	dos Santos discusses two dialects of the Kawahiva language: Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau [ISO: urz] and Karipuna [ISO: kuq]. This section covers Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau; Karipuna is addressed in a separate section. dos Santos proposes underlying N and contrastive nasal vowels, 2 phonological processes and 1 morphophonological process for Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau: (1) leftward LDNH, a nasal vowel spreads its nasality leftward, nasalizing oral vowels and glides {w, j}. {T, h} are transparent to this process while {ɾ, ʔ} block it (p.2-5); (2) leftward LN, nasal coarticulation on oral vowels preceding a pre-nasalized stop in a morpheme. Pre-nasalized stops are considered by the author to be allophones of N; (3) rightward MPP, lexically specified suffixes with morpheme-initial oral vowels nasalize when the preceding root ends either in a nasal consonant or a nasal vowel (p.6). dos Santos notes that this process is "cyclic, occuring each time a new suffix is added to the right edge of the stem" (p.6). Furthermore, dos Santos notes that during this morphophonological alternation, suffixes with more than one oral vowel can appear as fully nasalized, such as in the case of the suffix {uhu, AUG} which surfaces as {ũhũ}. 					
Notes:	Allophones are only mentioned to be "in complementary distribution or in free variation" (p.2) and no specific environments are proposed for their distribution. Despite there being no discussion with regards to allophones, dos Santos's data seems to suggest that /a/ has the following nasal allophones [ɐ̃, ə̃] while /o/ surfaces as [ɔ̃] in the LDNH process.  This paper discusses the same process for both Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau. Consequently, the summary presented for this paper is identical in both sheets, as no distinction is specifically made between the linguistic facts of the two dialects in the manuscript.

Summary:	Sampaio considers Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau and Parintintin as two dialects of the Kawahiva language (p.52). This summary covers the Amondawa dialect of Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau given that Sampaio notes data collection was done with the Amondawa. Sampaio proposes underlying N and 3 phonological processes for Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau: (1) leftward LO, oralization/post-oralization of {m, n, ɲ, ŋ, ŋʷ} word-initially before an oral vowel. The following allophones are observed in free variation:  [mb, b, m], [nd, d, n], [ɲ, dʒ, j], [ŋ, ɡ], [ŋʷ, ɡʷ]; (2) rightward LO, optional shielding of {m, n} to [DN] word-finally. Sampaio claims that N and DN are in free variation with each other; (3) leftward LO, post-oralization of N between a nasal and an oral vowel (p. 33-39, 42-43).					
Notes:	Sampaio's citation and analysis of Betts & Pease's (1971) work on Parintintin is included in the Tenharim section. Sampaio's data collection for the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau dialect was collected with the Amondava (p.30). Sampaio's (2001) dissertation was also looked at, but given that there are no descriptions of nasal harmony, it was not included.

Synthesis:	We adopt dos Santos' analysis of nasality-related (morpho-)phonological processes in Uru-eu-wau-wau. Specifically, we take the LDNH and MPP:V processes from the manuscript "Blocking effects of flap and glottal stop in nasal harmony processes in Kawahiva (Tupi-Guarani)", and the MPP:mb, LO and LN processes from the "Notas sobre o povo e língua Kawahiva: com referência especial ao(s) Uru Eu Wau Wau" manuscript. Following dos Santos, Uru-eu-wau-wau has a series of phonemic nasal consonants and a series of nasal vowels. (1) LDNH: Root-final nasal vowels trigger leftward LDNH to all /V, w, j/ within a root (but never extends beyond a root boundary), glottal stop and flap are opaque, and /T, h/ are transparent; (2) rightward MPP:mb: nasalization of oral vowel and pre-nasalization of /p, t, k/ to [mp, nt, ŋɡ] when the preceding morpheme ends in a nasal consonant, a nasal vowel, or when preceded by the causative prefix {mõ-}; (3) leftward LO, post-oralization of nasals /m, n, ŋ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ] before an oral vowel; (4) leftward LN, nasalization of an oral vowel when preceding a nasal consonant; (5) rightward MPP:V, whereby some suffixes with initial oral vowel (e.g. /-a, -uhu/) nasalize when previous root ends in a nasal consonant or nasal V.
