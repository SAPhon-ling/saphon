Summary:	Alves (2008) does not find oral/nasal alternations of the typical TG [D]~[ND]~[N] type, but does indicate that the language exhibits contrastive nasal and oral vowels. She proposes six phonological processes and one morphophonological process. (1) BN, where /a/ nasalizes to [ã] word-finally (p. 73-74). This nasalization process appears to be optional, as it does not affect all word-final /a/. (2) Leftward LN, where vowels optionally nasalize when immediately preceding /m, n/ (p. 73-74). (3) Rightward LN, where /ɾ/ nasalizes to [n] if the previous morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 74). (4) Leftward optional GN of /j/ to [j̃] ~ [ɲ] ~ [ɲʲ] before a nasal or nasalized vowel (p. 49).  (5) Leftward LNsyll, an optional process whereby oral vowels nasalize when the nucleus of the syllable immediately to its right is nasal, and the intervening segment is transparent. i.e., /ʔ, h/ ; (6) an allomorphy process, where the focus marker /ko/ and the negation marker /ja/ nasalize to /kũ/ and /ɲa/, respectively, when the previous morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 74 - 75); (7) BN, optional nasalization of /j/ to either [ɲ] or [ɲʲ] word-initially (p.49).  Note that there are as small number of transcribed forms that suggest that the segments other than laryngeal consonants may be transparent to to the LNSyll process described in (5) above. However, in these cases, underlying forms are not supplied, so that it is not clear if these are true counter-examples.  Alves notes that [b] is only attested in one word, [bɨdɛ] '1.PL' (p. 47) and considers [b] to be an allophone of /m/ (p. 47). It is uncertain from which process [b] could derive from /m/, however, and we did not code a process for this alleged alternation.

Summary:	Solano (2009) does not find oral/nasal alternations of the typical TG [D]~[ND]~[N] type, but does indicate that the language exhibits contrastive nasal and oral vowels. She proposes 5 phonological processes and 1 morphophonological process: (1) BN, where /j/ nasalizes to [ɲ] if it appears word-initially (p. 84); (2) rightward LN, where the nasalization of /j/ to [ɲ] in the previous process triggers the nasalization of the following vowel; (3) a different BN process, where word-final /a/ nasalizes to [ã] (p. 84); (4) LNsyll, where word-final nasal vowels nasalize sonorants in the preceding syllable (p. 84). The data suggests that voiceless obstruents act as transparent segments, where /tatã/ 'fire' surfaces as [tãtã] (p. 84); (5) rightward cross-word LN process, where /ɾ/ nasalizes to [n] if the preceding morpheme ends in a nasal vowel or nasalized vowel (p. 85). (6) rightward MPP, where the focus marker /ku/ and the negation marker /ja/ nasalize to [kũ] and [ɲa], respectfully, to adjacent nasal vowels (p. 85).  We observe that in all but one example of process (2), a nasal vowel is found somewhere to the right of [ɲ] in the word, suggesting some type of LDNH process.

Vieira and Leite posit two phonological processes: (1) leftward LN, /j/ nasalizes to [ɲ] in the environment of a nasal vowel (p. 9), located anywhere within the morpheme; (2) BN, where /a/ nasalizes to [ã] if it appears word-finally in a stressed syllable (p. 8).   The phoneme [b] was only noted to appear in one word [biðe] the self-designation for the Araweté people (p. 11), but it has been included in the natural classes and allophone rows.  /ɾ/ spirantizes to a 'alveolar fricatized flap', which has been interpreted as [ʒ]. <y> is considered to be /ɨ/.

Summary:	da Silva, Picanço, & Rodrigues only discuss oral vowels in Araweté and do not propose or discuss any harmony processes. Citing Silva (2009), the authors discuss the occurence of [ɪ] in Araweté. Natural classes, allophones, and analysis are cited from Silva's (2009) data so it may not completely reflect the phonemic inventory of Araweté; no inventory is proposed by the original authors. Nasal vowels are not proposed nor discussed. Citing Silva (2009) the authors note that [ɔ] occurs in few words in Araweté and that its phonological status is uncertain; it has been included as a phoneme in this case (p. 29). There is no proposal for contrastive nasal vowels.

Summary:	Source is an anthropological description on Araweté culture and spirituality. There is a short section on the phonemic inventory. Viveiros de Castro notes that all the vowels in Araweté can be nasalized and that /b/ can be lightly aspirated (p. 15). [ɪ] has been included as an allophone of /i/ based on the author's claim that this vowel is probably an allophone as opposed to a separate phoneme (p. 15).

Summary:	Sociolinguistic study of the different varieties of Portuguese spoken by the Asurini and the Araweté. There is a small section which describes the phonemic inventory of both languages and the associated orthography for each language; there are no descriptions of harmony processes.

Synthesis:	This synthesis largely follows Alves' (2008) analysis in of considering the language to lack typical TG alternations of the  [D]~[ND]~[N] type, but to exhibit contrastive nasal and oral vowels. We consider /b/ to be phonemic based on the author's claim that it appears in one data point [bɨdɛ] '1.PL'.     Following Alvez (2008) we originally proposed six processes. (1) BN, where /a/ optionally nasalizes to [ã] word-finally. (2) Leftward LN, where the right-most nasal consonant in a root nasalizes preceding oral vowels (p. 73-74). (3) Rightward LN, where /ɾ/ nasalizes to [n] if the previous morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 74). (4) Leftward optional LN  of /j/ to [j̃] ~ [ɲ] ~ [ɲʲ] before a nasal or nasalized vowel (p. 49).  (5) Leftward LNsyll, an optional process whereby oral vowels nasalize when the nucleus of the syllable immediately to its right is nasal, and the intervening segment is transparent. i.e., /ʔ, h/ ; (6) an allomorphy process, where the focus marker /ko/ and the negation marker /ja/ nasalize to /kũ/ and /ɲa/, respectively, when the previous morpheme ends in a nasal vowel (p. 74 - 75); (7) BN, optional nasalization of /j/ to either [ɲ] or [ɲʲ] word-initially (p.49).  However, a closer reading of the data presented in Alvez (2008) would reveal that the BN process is merely an sub-case of the GN process when it affects the word-initial glide. Adapting the gradience of the GN process to up to 3 syllables would account for all of the cases of BN under page 49. Consequently, we have ascertained that the gradience of the GN process -- despite it being unspecified in the original source -- to be at least 3 syllables.

Notes:	We eliminated the allophone of [ɲʲ] for LN:j because we are not certain on the exact phonetic difference between a palatal nasal and a palatalized palatal nasal.
