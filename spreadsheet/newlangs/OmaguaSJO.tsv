Summary:	For the inventory of underlying nasal segments Sandy & O'Hagan posit /m, n/ as well as a placeless/underspecified /ɴ/ for nasals in Omagua. The authors posit one phonological process: (1) leftward LN, where an underspecified /ɴ/ is deleted in the underlying form and surfaces as a suprasegment feature {~}, which docks onto the preceding vowel and nasalizes it in the surface form. The authors mention that this nasalization process can optionally affect vowels and glides following the deleted /ɴ/ and surfacing of {~}, which suggests that this process is bidirectional (p. 107). The underspecified /ɴ/ can also assimilate to the place of articulation of the voiceless stop adjacent to it and trigger optional voicing. Sandy & O'Hagan note that this LN process only occurs for 6 words in Omagua: {aɴi.3SG.FS}, {aɴi, grandmother}, {aɴja, thus}, {iɴja, heart}, {sɨɴi, sweat}, {suɴi, tail}.					
Notes:	No contrastive nasal vowels. There are only six words that undergo the LN process proposed by the authors.  "Fieldwork was conducted in the community of San Joaquín de Omaguas, located on the left bank of the Amazon River, as well as in the urban center of Iquitos, both in the Loreto region of Peru, from June to August 2010, June to August 2011, and in July 2013. The four primary consultants were Alicia Huanío Cabudivo (b. 1932), Lino Huanío Cabudivo (1936–2017), Amelia Huanaquiri Tuisima (b. 1930), and Arnaldo Huanaquiri Tuisima (1933–2016)."

Synthesis:	We adopt Sandy & O'Hagan's (2020) description of San Joaquín de Omaguas Omagua. Following Sandy & O'Hagan, we posit a series of 3 nasals for Omagua /m, n, ɴ/ with the final consonant being a placeless nasal, along with a series of 4 oral vowels /i, ɪ, u a/. The San Joaquín de Omaguas variety of Omagua has lost nasal vowels, different from the Kambeba variety. We adopt Sandy & O'Hagan's analysis in assuming one phonological process: (1) bidirectional LN, an underspecified, placeless nasal /ɴ/ deletes and surfaces as a supersegment {~}. This supersegment then docks onto the preceding vowel and nasalizes it, with optional nasalization of the following surface glide /i/ --> [j].
