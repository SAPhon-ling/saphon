Language:	Kayabí (Kawaiwete Jawarum)				
Alternate_Names:	Kaiwawete				
ISO_Codes:	kyz_jrm				
Glottocode:	kaya1329				
Synthesis:	This synthesis adopts Lapierre's (2019) phonological analysis of the Jawarum variety of Kawaiwete, given that it is the only description for this dialect. Following Lapierre, we consider the Jawarum variety to have underlying nasal consonants and a series of vowels which contrast for orality/nasality. One phonological processes occurs in the Jawarum dialect: (1) bidirectional LN, partial nasalization of oral vowels before or after a nasal consonant.				
Data inputter:	SCJ				
Date completed:					
Notes:	Lightly nasalized vowels are represented with the dieresis, i.e. [ɛ̈], to differentiate them from phonemically nasal vowels, i.e. /e/.
