Summary: 	This summary combines Dooley's 1984, 2006, and 1978/2008 articles given their similarity in analysis. It mainly follows Dooley (1984) and Dooley (2013), which provide more explicit descriptions of nasal harmony and nasal/oral processes in Mbyá, but page numbers have been included for all three publications (when relevant). The version of Dooley's 1984 article included in this summary is a Portuguese translation by Helena Vera Flor.  Dooley posits underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive oral/nasal vowels (V, Ṽ) for Mbyá, along with 5 processes related to orality/nasality: (1) leftward LDNH, in a prefix-root domain, the right-most nasal consonant or nasal vowel nasalizes all oral vowels and approximants /ɾ, w/. The trigger must occur in a root. Voiceless stops /p, t, k, kʷ, ʔ/ act as transparent to this process (1984:3-5, 2013:5-6). Dooley claims that this process is blocked by any morpheme which is not a prefix and contains an oral vowel; (2) rightward MPP, the causative prefix {mo-} triggers nasalization of root-initial /p, t, k, kʷ/ to [m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ] located within the adjacent root (1984:7-8); (3) rightward allomorphy selection, following a root-final nasal vowel, the following suffixes are nasalized: {pɨ, ʔi, i.NEG} to [pɨ̃, ʔĩ, ĩ.NEG] (1984:7, 2013:6); (4) leftward LO, post-oralization of nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ] to [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ] before an oral vowel (2013:3, 2013:5). 			
Notes:	No page numbers are given for Dooley's 1984 article; page numbers are assumed based on the PDF reader used to review that source.  Dooley's 1978/2008 article discusses topicalization in Mbyá. The footnotes briefly discusses nasal harmony in Mbyá and is consistent with Dooley's previous (1978) and later (2013) analyses: "Nasalization is regressive throughout a stem and its prefixes" (1978/2008:11).  The PDF of Dooley 2013 is missing some symbols from the phonemic and orthographic tables (2013:3). Furthermore, some of the symbols in his transcriptions are corrupted and were not properly converted to IPA.

Summary:	Guedes posits underlying nasal consonants and contrastive oral and nasal vowels for Mbyá, along with 8 processes related to orality/nasality: (1) leftward LDNH, syllables either have an "oral" or "nasal" accent. Phonemically nasal vowels occur in stressed syllables with nasal accents while phonemically oral vowels occur in stressed syllables with oral accents: "a ocorrência de vogais nasais em sílabas acentuadas, pórem, opõe-se de modo distintivo à ocorrência de vogais orais: [ɔˈke] 'ele dorma', [ɔ̃ˈkẽ] 'porta', [tuˈpã] 'cama', [tũˈpã] 'filho de Deus'" (p.21). Syllables with nasal accents spread their nasality leftward, nasalizing all oral vowels and /ɾ/ (p. 17-19, 22, 47); (2) leftward LO, post-oralization of /m, n, ŋ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ] (p.29-31). Guedes describes these allophones as "pre-nasalized", but the environment is consistent with an analysis of post-oralization, therefore, we include it as this process; (3) leftward LO, oralization of word-initial /ŋʷ, ɲ/ to [ɡʷ] and [dʒ], respectively, before an oral vowel (p. 31); (4) circumdirectional LO, oralization of /ŋʷ/ and /ɲ/ to [ɡʷ] and [dʒ], respectively, between two oral vowels (p.31); (5) leftward LO, post-oralization of /ŋʷ/ to [ɡʷ] between a nasal vowel and oral vowel (p.31); (6) rightward MPP, the causative prefix {mo} triggers pre-nasalization of the following root-initial /p, t, k, kʷ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ] (p.19-21); (7) rightward XMP, in a compound, non-head noun-initial /p, t, k, kʷ/ pre-nasalizes to [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ] after a head noun-final nasal vowel. If the non-head noun contains a nasal vowel, pre-nasalization does not occur (p.19); (8) leftward allomorphy selection, the diminutive suffix /ʔi/ to [ʔĩ] after a root-final nasal vowel (p.19).  Guedes provides a detailed analysis for the degree of nasalization of phonetically nasal vowels and oral syllables (which both are nasalized by the leftward LDNH process described above): "A extensão da nasalidade para à sílaba a esquerda acentuada se caracteriza por uma redução progressiva da qualidade nasal: aparentemente, o véu palatino apresenta menor baixamento nas sílabas mais distantes da acentuada e maior baixamento nesta...Entretanto, essas sílabas pareceme sempre ser nasalizadas, ainda que minimamente, pois nelas ocorrem os alofones nasais das consonantes passíveis de nasalização" (translation: "The spreading of leftward nasalization from the stressed syllable to other syllables is characterized by a decrease in nasal quality: aparently, the soft palate lowers less in stressed syllables and lowers more in those ones [unstressed syllables]...Therefore, these syllables always appear as nasalized, even minimally, since within those syllables, nasal allophones of [certain] consonants which undergo nasalization occur", p. 18).  Guedes excludes /tʲ/ as undergoer for MPP:TtoND (pre-nasalization of root-initial obstruents to [ND]s after a root-final nasal vowel) due to the following reasoning: "Não temos exemplos da ocorrência de /ty/ nesse contexto, mas supomos que seu comportamento seria análogo ao que se dá após o prefixo causativo, isto é, a ele corresponderia a [nd]" (p.19). Following Guedes' claim, we also exclude /tʲ/ from the underɡoers section of this process.  The "nasal accent" referred to by Guedes is described to be/originate in the nasal vowel of an accented syllable. Therefore, we code it as Ṽ́ as a trigger.

Summary:	Martins' dissertation focuses on Mbyá syntax but includes a section on phonology. The author's phonemic tables include allophones but the author does not expand on their distribution or provide any phonological rules to account for these allophones, therefore, the environments in the allophones list has been included as NA.  Martins proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V) for Mbyá. The author posits two processes: (1) leftward LN, nasalization of oral vowels before a nasal consonant (p.194, footnote 75); (2) leftward allomorphy selection, nasalization of the inactive prefix {i-} to [ʔiɲ] or [iɲ] before a nasal vowel (p.88). This second process seems to occur because of cylicity from the previous LN process (as Martins does not posit underlying nasal vowels in Mbyá).  Martins includes the allophones for nasal consonants in Mbyá: [ɳu̯, ɳɡu̯, ɡu̯, ku̯, mb, nd, ŋɡ], which Martins explains as follows: "A língua apresenta alguns segmentos complexos como as seqüências oclusiva/nasal+ vocóide alto arrendondado assilábico ɳu̯, ɳgu̯, gu̯, ku̯ e outros de contorno como as seqüências de segmentos consonantal nasal + oclusiva sonora mb, nd, ŋɡ, e oclusiva + fricativa tʃ, dʒ" (p.169). It is most likely that the [ɳ] is a typo and should actually be [ŋ], in accordance with the phonemic and allophonic inventories proposed by Martins. It is also possible that [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡu] are post-oralized allophones of /m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ/, respectively, but these are described as pre-nasalized (p.194, footnote 75). Therefore, they have been included as allophones of these nasal consonants and the environment has been included as NA. 			
Notes:	Martins does not propose underlying nasal vowels.

Synthesis:	We largely assume Guedes' analysis of Mbyá, though unlike her, we assume that vowels do contrast for nasality at the segmental level, and that LDNH is the result of leftward LDNH spreading from a phonemically nasal vowel or consonant to the left edge of the (series of) prefix(es). We assume that LO causes underlying /N/s to become post-oralized [ND] before contrastively oral vowels. We assume that LN causes a root- or suffix-initial voiceless stop /T/ to become nasalized [N] (or prenazalized [ND] when followed by an oral vowel as per the LO process) when it occurs after root-final contrastively nasal vowel (either in a compound or sufix-derivational structure), and the causative prefix mo- also triggers this process to root-initial /T/s. We also assume that some suffixes present nasal-oral allomorphs, where the nasal allomorph is selected when attaching to a root ending in a contrastively nasal vowel, and the oral allomorph is selected when attaching to a root ending in an oral vowel. The list of alternating suffixes is taken from Dooley 1984 & Guedes.
