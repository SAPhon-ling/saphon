Summary:	Cardoso assumes a system in which vowels and consonants both contrast for [+/-nasal]. Voiceless stops/osbtruents are [-cont, -nas]; nasal stops are [-cont, +nas]; and approximants are [+cont, -nas]. The author assumes three phonological rules: (1) LO; (2) Velar Deletion; and (3) leftward LDNH. According to LO, nasal consonants become post-oralized when preceding a nasal vowel, and become fully oralized when flanked by two oral vowels. According to Velar Deletion, velar nasals delete before nasal vowels (to account for the [ŋw, ŋ] are unattested on the surface). According to LDNH, nasal vowels trigger leftward nasal harmony of V, R, N, up until the left root edge, or the left prefix edge, and there is free variation with respect to whether or not LDNH crosses prefix-root boundaries.		
Notes:	Does not discuss any suffixes, very little discussion of the role of morphological types and domains in general. The author only mentions that prefixes vary for oral and nasal: The same prefix,root boundary may be either opaque or transparent within the same word on different utterances of that word.

Notes:	LDNH:ND and LDNH:prefixes are very likely two different descriptions of the same phonological process, but this is never explicitly stated by the authors. LDNH:ND is defined in phonological terms, while LDNH:prefixes is defined in morpheme-specific terms

Data inputter:	MJL		
Summary:	Bridgeman assumes a system in which nasal autosegments /~/ attach to the right edge of a root, namely to a stressed vowel, and trigger leftward nasalization of a grammatical word. Vs and Ds are nasalized by this process, and T, S, R are transparent. There seems to also be an assumption made by the author that all voiced stops preceding an ND are nasalized as well (leftward), but this is not discussed explicitly. Ds are considered underlying, and Ns and NDs are allophones of voiced stops.		
Notes:	"Nasalization is most prominent on the stressed syllable and freely fluctuates with the lack of nasalization on the vowels of weak stressed syllables." (1961, p. 332) "In rapid speech nasalization occurs with larger grammatical units than the word. [...] In Text 3, words 3 through 4 nasalization occurs with the entire grammatical sentence and across juncture." (1961, p. 332) "Continuant allophones [i.e. m, n...] occur with the prosodic phoneme of nasalization and preceding the occurrence of a pre-nasalized allophone within the same word" (1961, p.331) There is a problem with the analysis presented in the quote from p. 331, in that the triggering environment for the occurrence of pre-nasalized stops is never stated so it is unclear how they come about. This is partially resolved in a note from the later dissertation, but still doesn't explain how prenasalized stops come about from voiced stops: "Voiced stops are prenasalized in oral words, nasal continuants in nasal words. Nasal words are those in which the prosodic feature of nasalization occurs. Nasalization accompanies a nasal vowel or a voiced stop, in either case all preceding voiced stops within the word are continuants." (p. 8) It seems that this dialect of Kaiowá does not have plain [b, d, g], but only [j, gw]. Rather, it has prenasalized [mb, nd, ŋɡ].

Summary:	According to this analysis, certain whole morphemes are intrinsically nasal. According to morphemic LDNH, intrinsically nasal morphemes trigger nasalization of morphemes that precede them--unless blocked by a glottal stop. According to segmental LDNH, [mb, nd, ŋɡ] likewise trigger leftward nasalization up until a L|Prefix|Edge. Glottal stops can likewise block this, but there may be more than one nasal span in the phonoogical word if there is more than one ND, crucially on either side of the blocking glottal stop. According to LN, a nasal consonant will nasalize an immediately preceding oral vowel (but will not affect the preceding ND consonant). According to nasal-oral allomorphy, some suffixes (e.g. py/my) are fully nasalized when they follow a nasal root, and fully oral when they follow an oral root. Finally, if the root morpheme is intrinsically nasal and it is not followed by an oral suffix, the last syllable of the root (containing the stressed vowel) will be denasalized. In this analysis, NDs and Ns are both considered phonemic.		
Notes:	Relevant definitions: the authors describe a "stress group" to, vaguely, be a "group of syllables which can occur immediately before and after a syllable which has primary stress". They do not describe the range of this "group". They define a "nucleus" to be the "syllable with primary stress and all syllables that precede it in a stress group". Finally, they describe a "margin" to be "the syllables that may follow the syllable that has primary stress".   Dialect spoken at the Francisco Horta Post, Dourados, Mato Grosso, Brazil "The question of the taxonomic phonemic status of such pairs as m-mb and n-nd is not considered in this paper." Only talk about py/my but mention that other suffixes undergo as well.

Synthesis:	We largely follow Cardoso's analysis of nasality in Kaiowá, though add specific details relation to morpho(phono)logical properties of the language that she does not discuss. Specifically, we follow Harrison & Taylor's description of nasal-oral allomorphy process. We assume that there are other suffixes that pattern with {py}, though none of the authors list them explicitly. The nasal span in a morpheme has at its right edge a nasal segment, and the nasal span runs all the way to the left edge of a prosodic word boundary, including all potential prefixes. When a voiced stop is wholly contained inside a nasal span, it surfaces as fully nasal (e.g. [m]); when it is wholly contained inside an oral span, it surfaces as fully oral (e.g. [b]); and when it appears at the boundary between a nasal and an oral span, its surfaces as partially nasal (e.g. [mb]).
