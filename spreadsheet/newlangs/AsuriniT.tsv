Summary:	Nicholson does not identify any general phonological consonantal or vocalic nasal/alternations in the language, nor any voiced oral stops. She proposes underlying nasal consonants and oral vowels alongside three morphophonological processes that affect nasal consonants in certain roots of Asuriní do Tocantins (pp. 5-6): (1) leftward LO,  root-final [m], [n], and [ŋ] oralize to [p], [t], and [k] when followed by the suffix /-a/, (pp. 2-3). The author only provides examples for the following roots {ósym, omókom, óken, óeron, oeságokan, ó'ag, omósywag} and claims that LO does not necessarily occur for all roots in Asuriní do Tocantins that contain word-final [m]; (2) leftward LO, where root-final nasals [m, n, ŋ] oralize to [p, h, k], respectively, in which the nominalizer suffix {-awa} triggers this process; and (3) leftward LO, where the suffixes {-i, -y'ym, -rame, -ete, -ypy, -eme} cause [m] and [n] in certain roots to lenite to [w, ɾ], respectively. This process only occurs in the following roots: {omókom, ópam, ó'am, óken, okáapin, ó'an} (p. 3) and does not have to occur for all roots with root-final nasals. Nicholson notes that when followed by the {-i} suffix, verbs in Asuriní do Tocantins become 'de-emphasized' (p. 3).					
Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Notes:	Nicholson does not provide a gloss for the {-a} suffix and does not explain what it means when a verbal root becomes 'de-emphasized'.  Each MPP process posited by Nicholson contains data which does not undergo morphophonological alternations, including explicit claims by Nicholson who notes the following for the MPP:NtoT process: "Quando o radical verbal termina em nasal e torna-se um verbo não-iniciante (com a adição do sufixo a) a nasal se torna plosiva. (Entretanto, há exceções.)" (p. 2, author's emphasis), as well as claims throughout the manuscript which suggest that these processes may be optional in Asuriní do Tocantins: "NB. Há casos em que o 'm' não muda" (p. 5), "NA. Nenhuma mudança no 'm' do sufixo negativo" (p. 3). Given these descriptions, we believe that these morphophonological alternations are categorical for the specific data included by Nicholson. For the morphemes that do not undergo these processes (as described by Nicholson), we believe that they are not affected. Therefore, Optionality for these processes has been included as "Categorical", however further research is required to determine this fact.

Summary:	Soares cites Harrison's (1976) analysis and does not present any of her own analysis. In Soares' citation, Harrison (1976) proposes two morphophonological processes: (1) leftward MPP, in which the dependent suffix {-ta} triggers oralization of [m, n, ŋ] in certain Asuriní roots, which oralize to [p, t, k], respectively (p. 68-69). This processes only affects the following roots: {opam, oken, iˀaŋ}. Soares also notes that this process does not affect other roots that contain word-final nasals and does not expand on Harrison's analysis as to why other roots are not affected; (2) leftward MPP, the suffixes {-rame, now} and {-oho, really} trigger the oralization of verbs with root-final [m] and [n] to [ɾ] and [w], respectively (p. 65-66). After these processes are explained, the author mainly discusses historical processes of Guajajára and Asuriní do Tocantins, proposing that Asuriní do Tocantins lost nasalized vowels and therefore does not have LDNH.					
Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Notes:	Author does not mention where data was collected from or from who, only that Asurini is spoken in Posto Indígeno do Trocará, in the state of Pará (p. 8).   Soares relies on Harrison's (1976) analysis for nasal-oral alternation processes. Soares also cites Harrison (1967) and Nicholson (1977) - wasn't able to locate. The data the author cites from Harrison for LO triggered by the suffixes {-oho, -rame} do not appear in Harrison (1976).

Summary:	This article is a Portuguese translation by Mary I. Daniel of Harrison's (1975) original English publication. Harrison posits underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V) for Asuriní do Tocantins and four morphophonological processes: (1) leftward MPP, root-final /m, n, ŋ/ oralize to [p, t, k], respectively, followed by the dependent suffix {-ta} (p.119). Only one example is provided as evidence of this process: /pam/ 'to finish oralizing to [pap]; (2) leftward MPP, lenition and oralization of root-final /m, n/ to [w, ɾ], respectively, before oral vowels (p.199); (3) rightward MPP, some verbs with initial /p, t, k/ nasalize to [m, n, ŋ] after the causative prefix {mo-} (p.188). Harrison notes that only some verb roots undergo this alternation while others do not ("Alguns temas verbais têm P, T ou K inicial. Quando precedidos de mo– 'causativo', P, T e K se apresentam como m, n e ŋ, respectivamente. Nos outros casos, aparecem com p, t, k", p.118) which leads us to belief that this process is restricted to a lexically specified set of verb roots in Asuriní do Tocantins. Because of the author's claim, the morpheme IDs in the Undergoers section has been included as "lexically specified roots with initial /p, t, k/.; (4) rightward MPP, oralization and lenition of /m/ to [w] in transitive verbs (p.118). Harrison only provides one example for this process: {nahɨ, injured} which appears as {wahɨ}.					
Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Notes:	Data collected from speakers who lived in Posto Indígena Trocará (p. 7).   Paper addresses discourse in Asuriní do Tocantins, and provides short section at end of paper discussing morphophonological rules. This section contains few examples. Harrison notes that the suffix {-ta} is a dependent suffix.   For the LO:NtoW process, Harrison notes that the archiphoneme /ŋ/ remains as /ŋ/ (p. 119) and does not expand on this.   Harrison uses <c> to denote a sound that represents "alveolar to alveopalatal fricatives and affricates" (p. 10); it has been assumed that [ts] is the underlying phoneme and that there is free variation between /ts, tʃ, s, ʃ/ (p. 10).  The default realization of /e/ might actually be /ɛ/, based on the following note from Harrison: "e (na maioria dos casos [ɛ])" (p.10). There is no further description of this phoneme/allophone's occurrence by Harrison, so the phoneme has been left as /e/.

Summary:	Harrison posits underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V) along with 3 morphophonological processes for Asuriní do Tocantins: (1) rightward MPP, certain verbs roots with initial /p, t, k/ are realized as [m, n, ŋ] after the causative prefix {mo-} (p. 40-41). For this process, Harrison notes that "certain verb stems which under most conditions begin with stops, begin with corresponding nasals". The claim that this process only affects "certain verb stems" leads us to believe that this process is limited to a certain set of roots in Asuriní do Tocantins, and thus, the morpheme IDs row for the undergoers has been labelled as "lexically specified roots with initial /p, t, k/; (2) leftward MPP, oralization of root-final /m, n, ŋ/ to [p, t, k] before the dependent suffix {-ta} (p.44-45); (3) leftward MPP, oralization and lenition of /m, n/ to [w, ɾ] before a vowel-initial suffix (p.44-45).

Laboratório de Línguas Indígenas, Universidade de Brasília.					
Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Cabral et al. posit underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V), along with 3 processes for Asuriní do Tocantins: (1) leftward LN, light nasalization of oral vowels in stressed syllables before a tautosyllabic nasal consonant (p.26); (2) BN, boundary nasalization of /w, ɾ, k/ to [m, n, ŋ] "before silence" (p.27); (3) leftward MPP, nasalization of root-final /k/ to [ŋ] before all derivational and inflection suffixes except when before the gerund {-a} and the nominalizer {-aw} (p.27). Cabral et al. include the prohibitive suffixe {-eme} and the intensifier suffix {-ete} as two of the possible triggers in their examples. We include those suffixes as part of the environment for this process in the allophones list. It should be noted that since Cabral et al. claim this process is triggered by most derivational and inflectional suffixes, the inclusion of {-eme} and {-ete} as triggers in the allophones list is not meant to be exhaustive, but is meant to represent what the authors argue based on the data they include.					
Notes:	Cabral et al. note that Asurini do Tocantins lost its nasal vowels and therefore lost the constrat between oral/nasal vowels (p. 27). The authors note that vowels are lightly nasalized before nasal consonants ("Todas as vogais podem ser realizadas ligeiramente nasalizadas em sílaba acentuada diante de uma consoante nasal", p.26). We use the diaresis to represent this process, i.e. [ë].  Vowels are shortened in final unstressed syllables (p. 26). We use [ĕ] to represent this process. Vowels are laryngealized before or after /ʔ/ (p. 26). In the allophones list, a tilde underneath the vowel represents this process [ḛ].  The vowels [i] and [o] are deleted if they are in the environment of vowel or semivowel of a similar quality (p. 27): [i] is deleted following [j] while [o] is deleted following [o]. The vowel [o] can also be dipthongized to [w] when the following vowel is of a different quality than [e] (p. 27).   The authors note that the phonological alternations that occur in Asuriní do Tocantins are very similar to those in Parakanã (p. 25). In C1C2 clusters, the initial C is deleted unless the initial consonant of the cluster is /s/ or the second consonant of the cluster is /t/ (p. 27).

Synthesis	We base this synthesis mainly on Nicholson (1975/2009) and Harrison (1975), which are the two previous works with most substantive empirical engagement with the language. Asuriní does not exhibit alternation of [N]~[ND]~[D] type, not does it have contrastive nasal vowels. However, it does exhibit a number of morphophonological alternations affecting some consonants that undergo oralization or nasalization in the presence of certain affixes or lexically specified roots. Following Harrison we posit: (1) an LO process by which root-final /m, n, ŋ/ surface [p, t, k] in certain verb roots before the suffixes -a and -ta; (2) LO - {m, n} go to {w, ɾ} in certain roots; (3) LO - {m, n, ŋ} go to {p, h, k} in certain roots. We sided with Nicholson in the oralization of root-final /m, n/ into [w, ɾ], because we found it implausible that Nicholson would fail to notice an obvious natural group of vowel-initial suffixes. Following Harrison: (1) LO /N/ --> [T] before -ta; (2) LN /T/ --> [N] after mo-; (3) LO /n/ --> [w] after mo-. Asuriní lost contrastive nasal vowels, and therefore LDNH.
