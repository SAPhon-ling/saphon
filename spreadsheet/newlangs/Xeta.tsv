Summary:	Rodrigues only mentions a process of unconditioned nasalization of initial <w, y> where <y> is likely [j]. There is no proposed phonemic inventory or any other information about nasality.					
Notes:	Quite short, includes mostly anthropological and comparative information, including a lot of morphosyntactic analysis					
Include in SAPhon:	No	Why? 1) There is no phonemic inventory proposed by the author. 2) There is no description of nasal-oral alternations other than the BN process.

Summary:	Vasconcelos proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and nasal vowels (Ṽ) and proposes 4 processes: (1) leftward LO, optional post-oralization of nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ] before an oral vowel, resulting in the following free variation: [m] ~ [mb], [n] ~ [nd], [ŋ] ~ [ŋɡ] (p. 31); (2) spontaneous nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] in an unstressed syllable. As noted by the author, this exhibits variation and seems optional: "A variante nasal [ň] é interpretada aqui como um alofone de /ɾ/ devido a variação com este som, tal fenômeno pode ser exeplificado com a palavra quati:  [kaɾaˈmaj] ~ [kaňaˈmaj]" (The nasal allophone [ň] is interpreted as an allophone of /ɾ/ due to the variation it presents with this sound. This process can be exemplified through the word for coati: [kaɾaˈmaj] ~ [kaňaˈmaj]", p. 39), resulting in [ɾ] ~ [ɾ̃]; (3) BN, word-initial /w, j/ nasalize to [w̃] and [ɲ], respectively (p.39-40); (4) rightward LN, nasalization of /w, j/ to [w̃] and [ɲ] after a nasal vowel (p.39-40).  Vasconcelos uses the symbol [ᵻ] (dotless barred i) to denote a lax version of /ɨ/. Vasconcelos lists [ɪ̃] as a phone, but it is excluded from Vasconcelos' description of phonemes in Xetá and their respective allophones. It is most likely that [ɪ̃] is an allophone of /ẽ/ and is in free variation with nasal [ẽ] as oral [ɪ] is noted by the author as an allophone of oral /e/ ("[ɪ] varia livremente com [e]", p. 42). [ś] represents a "pre-palatal fricative" (fricativo pre-palatal, p. 24); it is free variation with /tʃ/ "in an oral environment" ("em ambiente oral", p. 36). Our best guess is that this is a slightly fronted /s/ or perhaps a dental /s/. This sound has been represented as [s̟]. [dź] represents a "voiced pre-palatal affricate" (africado pre-palatal, sonoro, p 22) and is an allophone of /dʒ/. Our best guess is that it is [d̟z̟], given the author's description of it being "pre-palatal". [ɗ] is used by Vasconcelos to represent a "voiceless dental lenis stop"; we have interpreted this as a voiceless dental stop [t̪], as it is not clear to us what notion of 'lenis' is being invoked here.  In his list of phones for Xetá, Vasconcelos also includes a series of labialized and velarized sounds. Both labialization and palatalization of consonants are considered a sequence of two phonemes and not allophones of plain obstruents, following Vasconcelos' claims: "Na língua Xetá a maioria dos segmentos consonantais labializados foram interpretados como seqüências de dois fonemas, o segundo dos quais é o aproximante labial /w/" (In Xetá the majority of labialized segments were interpreted as a series of two phonemes, of which the second one is the labio-velar approximant /w/", p. 30) and "A palatalização, quando ocorre com segmento consonantal alveolar ou com africado, foi interpretada como un alofone de fonema africado, nos demais casos a ocorrência de uma consoante palatalizada foi interpretada como uma seqüência de dois sons consonantais" (p. 30).  In his list of Xetá phones, Vasconcelos mentions two sounds whose descriptions we have difficulty interpreting: "[d̥] oclusivo alveolar, surdo, lenis" (voiceless alveolar lenis stop, p. 19) and "[ɡ̊] oclusivo velar, surdo, lenis" (voiceless velar lenis stop, p. 20)". We have included these allophones in their respective environments but note that further clarification is necessary to determine what these exact phones are.  Note that in the section in which Vasconcelos addresses the optionality of the local oralization process, described above, he actually does not provide evidence for the optionality  of the  /ŋ/ > [ŋɡ] oralization process, although he does do so for /m/ > [mb] and /n/ > [nd]. We nonetheless code the oralization process as optional for places of articulation since he does explicitly claim of the oralization process that "está presente em toda a série nasal ([mb], [nd] e [ŋg]) e é aparentemente opcional [...]" (pg. 31).   One data point in Vasconcelos's transcriptions, /'tapujĩka/ --> ['tapujĩŋka] 'armação de casa' (p.47), suggests that /k/ may undergo prenasalization. Similarly, the data points /ma'tʃĩwe/ → [ma'tʃĩŋɡwe] 'branquear' (p.47) and /ˈwajka/ → [ˈŋɡwajka] 'guaricanga' (p. 40) suggests that /w/ might also have [ŋɡʷ] as an allophone following nasal vowels, despite Vasconcelos's claim that [ŋʷ] is the only nasal allophone of /w/, which surfaces following nasal vowels (as noted in the LN process).

Synthesis:	This synthesis essentially follows Vasconcelos' (2008) analysis of Xetá phonology. We correspondingly treat Xetá as having underlying nasal consonants (N), and a series of vowels which contrast for orality (V) and nasality (Ṽ). Xetá does not exhibit LDNH and all nasalization and oralization processes are strictly local, of which we identify three: (1) leftward LO, optional post-oralization of nasal consonants /m, n/ to [mb, nd] before an oral vowel, resulting in the following variation: [m] ~ [mb], [n] ~ [nd]. This difference in optionality can be observed in the following data points from Vasconcelos: /'moj/ → [ˡmbɔj] ~ [ˡmɔj] 'cobra', /ˈkono/ → [ˈkondo] ~ [kono] 'fino' (p. 31); (3) leftward LO, obligatory post-oralization of /ŋ/ to [ŋɡ] before an oral vowel, as seen in /ˈpoŋa/ → [ˈpoŋɡa] 'inchado, pobre', /atʃiˈɾoŋe/ → [atʃiˈɾoŋɡi] 'estranho (pessoa de fora)', (p. 31), /kaˈŋodʒo/ [kaˈŋɡodʒo] 'coró grande' (p.36); (2) SN, spontaneous nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] in an unstressed syllable. This process results in variation: [ɾ] or [ɾ̃], as per Vasconcelos' data: /kaɾa'maj/ → [kaɾa'maj] ~ [kaňa'mbaj] 'coati' (p. 39). We have left this example of variation between a nasal and nonnasal segment in this synthesis despite not having a nasal trigger as it is not explained in any other way elsewhere.  We diverge from Vasconcelos' analysis in the following ways: (1) we consider  [ɡʷ] to be the surface realization of/kw/ sequences before oral vowels, as opposed to [ɡʷ] being an allophone of /w/. This decision is supported by Vasconcelos' transcriptions: /haˈmekwi/ [haˈmeɡʷi] 'ventre dele', /pekwi/ [peɡʷi] 'casca' (p. 42), /taˈpekwa/ [taˈpeɡʷa] ~ [taˈpɛɡʷa] 'esteira' (p. 43), /ˈuɨɾakwa/ [ˈuɨˈɾaɡʷa] 'ponta de flecha' (p.53); (2) we consider /ŋʷ/ to be its own phoneme (rather than an allophone of /w/, as Vasconcelos regards it), with an optional post-oralized allophone [ŋɡʷ] before an oral vowel. We consider this process to be optional given that some of Vasconcelos' surface transcriptions including /ŋʷ/ either occur as [ŋʷ] or [ŋɡʷ]: [ŋɡʷaˈɾapʲa] 'flecha para pássaros, com côco de macauba' (p. 28), [ŋwa'pɾajd̥ekə̃] 'púna' (p. 19), [təŋʷəŋɡa] 'jaracatia' (p.27),  [maˈʃĩŋɡwe] 'branquear' (p.47); (3) we consider /ŋʷ/ and /ɲ/ to be their own phonemes (rather than allophones of /w/ and /j/, as per Vasconcelos' analysis) for the following reason: the supposed conditioning environment that triggers surface [ŋʷ] and [ɲ], i.e. after a nasal vowel, does not, in fact always condition these supposed nasal allophones, e.g., we find [j], not [ɲ] in the post-nasal vowel environement: /ĩjadʒe/ [ĩˈjadʒɪ] 'trovaõ' (p.47), [ʃãwʃãw'aj] 'gralha, quando a comem' (p.13), and we find [ɲ] appearing  without the supposed conditioning environment, e.g., [aɲinɔ] 'ele se deito' (p.20); similarly, we find [w] in the post-nasal environment in which [ŋʷ] should appear:  /tʃãw/ [tʲə̃w] 'não há, não tem' (p. 30). Given this data, we exclude from our synthesis the rightward LN process that Vasconcelos posits for Xetá to account for surface [ŋʷ] and [ɲ]; (4) we consquently consider /ɲ/ to optionally oralize to [j] ~ [dʒ] (rather than /j/ being its own phoneme that nasalizes to [ɲ], as Vasconcelos claims, see (3) above) before an oral vowel, resulting in variation among the surface phones [ɲ] ~ [j] ~ [dʒ] (and [tʃ], see below). Data that support this interpretation include: [teˈjona] 'comer' and  [gʊˈɾajɛ] 'acreditar' (p.47),  where /ɲ/ surfaces as [j] preceding an oral vowel, and  [ˈɲoj] 'sopro',[ɲaneˈkawa] 'criança' (p.41), which show the nasal allophone surfacing in this evnvironment. Furthermore,  Vasconcelos' claim that [j] occurs in variation with affricates [dʒ] and [tʃ] leads us to consider them all to be allophones of /ɲ/.  We exclude [d] as an intervocalic allophone of /t/, despite Vasconcelos' claim that surfaces when the onset of the preceding syllable is a "voiceless lenis consonant" (p. 33), since there is no unambigous data presented that supports this claim (for example, one of the few such instances of this surface phone, [ɲẽdʊ] 'spider' (p.19) is a somewhat unexpected transcription of /ɲenu/ [ɲẽndu]). Identical transcriptions of the same word are inconsitent and include /t/, /d/, or /n/ as the underlying phoneme (NB: not the surface allophones), despite Vasconcelos only proposing underlying voiceless obstruents and nasal consonants as phonemes in Xetá. Given these inconsistencies, we exclude intervocalic voicing and voiced obstruents as allophones of voiceless obstruents from this synthesis.  Post-oralization of nasal stops is optional preceding unambiguously oral vowels, but we never find post-oralized stops to the left of nasal consonants, be they fully nasal or post-oralized. This is consistent with the existance of nasal spans in the language, which in turn entails some form of leftward LDNH. We can, however, say very little more about this process due to the paucity of data and the variability in the way forms are transcribed. We, however, coded the oralization of /ŋ/ -> [ŋɡ] as categorical, seeing that all the examples with a surfacing [ŋɡ] exhibit categorical postoralization (31)

Notes:	Vasconcelos uses [b̥, d̥, ɡ̊] to represent "voiceless lenis stops", which are allophones of /p, t, k/, respectively. Between Vasconcelos describing these phones as 'lenis', and as occuring intervocalically, one could imagine that these phones exhibit some degree of spirantization, but the fact that he describes these phones as 'oclusivos' (i.e. stops) results in us being unable to interpret what he means, and thus we exclude them from the list of allophones in this synthesis.  The symbol [ᵻ] (dotless barred i) is used by Vasconcelos to represent a lax version of barred i.
