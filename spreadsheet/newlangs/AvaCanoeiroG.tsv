Summary:	Borges addresses two varieties of Avá-Canoeiro: Tocantins and Goiás, spoken in their respective states. The Goiás variety is included in this summary, while the Tocantins variety is included in a separate sheet. Nasal-oral alternations are identical across both varieties with the exception of (1) optional (post)-oralization of /m, n/ to [m~mb~b, n~nd~d] syllable-initially before an oral vowel, which is restricted to the Tocantins variety.  For the Goiás variety, Borges proposes underlying nasal consonants and contrastive oral and nasal vowels. Four processes are posited: (1) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] before or after a nasal vowel. Borges notes that this process occurs mainly in stressed syllables (p. 85-86); (2) bidirectional LN, nasalization of glides /w, j/ to [w̃, j̃~ɲ] before or after a nasal vowel, primarily in stressed syllables. This process and the one before it have been separated based on the fact that the Borges claims nasalization of tap is optional; (3) leftward LN, /m, n, ŋ/ trigger nasalization of preceding oral vowels (p. 90-91); (4) rightward MPP, the final nasal vowel of a root triggers nasalization of the locative suffix {-pe} to {-m}  (p. 124-125).  For the nasalization of approximants, there are some forms within Borges' data that can't be derived using the LN rules the author proposes, which suggests that there might be an LDNH rule in Avá-Canoeiro that affects approximants and vowels; this possible rule is not addressed by Borges.					
Notes:	Avá-Canoeiro contains contrastive nasal vowels as well as oral vowels that can be nasalized. Borges notes that there are 22 speakers of Avá-Canoeiro and most of them live in the village of Canoanã (p. 20) in the state of Tocantins. The author cites Paiva's (1996) phonemic inventory, but proposes her own analysis.   Aspiration of voiceless obstruents in stressed syllables or word-initially seems to be optional (p. 81) and occurs in conditioned free variation with stops with schwa excrescence.  Borges notes that contrary to the other languages of Subgroup IV, Avá-Canoeiro does not contain the glottal stop [ʔ] in its inventory.   For the allophones of /w/, [ɢʷ] is used in careful speech while [w] is used in fast speech (p. 87).   Vowels are lengthened in stressed syllables.

Synthesis	We adopt Borges' analysis of Avá-Canoeiro Goiás, given that it is the only description for this variety of Avá-Canoeiro. Following Borges' analysis, we assume a series of 3 nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/ and a series of six vowels that contrast in orality-nasality /i, ɨ, e, a, o, u/, and adopt 4 (morpho)-phonological processes: (1) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of /ɾ/ to [ɾ̃] before or after a nasal vowel, primarily in stressed syllables; (2) bidirectional LN, obligatory nasalization of glides /w, j/ to [w̃], [j̃] ~ [ɲ], respectively, before or after a nasal vowel, primarily in stressed syllables; (3) leftward LN, nasalization of oral vowels before nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/; (4) rightward allomorphy, nasalization of the locative suffix {-pe} to {-m} after a nasal vowel in the previous morpheme.  We differ from Borges' analysis in proposing an additional process of leftward LDNH, where a nasal vowel or nasal consonant triggers nasalization of sonorants, including oral vowels and the approximants /ɾ, w, j/, with voiceless obstruents (p, t, tʃ, k, kʷ) acting as blockers.   We assume LDNH to occur in the Goiás variety of Avá-Canoeiro for the following reason: transcriptions in Borges' analysis for local nasalization processes result in surface forms which cannot be derived solely from local rules, for example: /kujã/ → [qʊ̃'ɲə̃ː] ~ [qʊ̃'j̃ə̃ː] 'mulher', /o-jeŋ/ → [õ'ɲẽːŋə] ~ [õ'j̃ẽːŋə] 'ele está falando', /i-waŋ/ → [ɪ'w̃ə̃ːŋə] 'é vermelho', /kuɾum/ → [qʊ'ɾ̃ũːm] ~ [qʊ'ɾũːm] 'menino' (p. 85); /wama/ → ['w̃ə̃ːmə] 'pasto', /o-momew/ → [ˌõmõˈmeːw] 'ele conversou' (p. 90).  The positoinal restrictions of LN processes are inferred from the documented cases of LNs; they are not explicitely stated.

Notes:	Despite Borges' claim that nasalization of tap and glides occurs primarily in stressed syllables, data for this process only shows nasalization in stressed syllables.
