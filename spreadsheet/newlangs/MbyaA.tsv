Summary:	Thomas' paper contains two types of analysis: (1) a descriptive/derivational one (which is the focus of this summary, discussed below) and (2) an OT analysis modeling nasality through constaints. Two constraints are proposed by the author to account for nasality in Mbyá: (1) AGREE-σ (±[nasal]. A non-directional agreement constraint with regards to syllable nuclei. If one syllable nucleus is nasal, then the other syllable nucleus must also be nasal (resulting in LDNH) and (2) and a constraint that requires that vowels and consonants agree in nasality (resulting in LN), i.e. nasal consonants (or the nasal part of complex nasal consonants, e.g., Vmb > Ṽmb) nasalizing adjacent oral vowels and nasal vowels nasalizing the voiced oral parts of adjacent complex nasal consonants (mbṼ > mṼ) . For this latter constraint both underlying nasal vowels and nasalized vowels can serve as triggers.  Note that, according to this constraint,  voiceless stops and voiceless affricates are not nasalized.  Thomas claims that nasal vowels and complex nasal consonants are the underlying triggers of nasal harmony in Mbyá. The author posits three phonological processes and one morphological process: (1) leftward LDNH with a domain of the prefix and root, with the trigger being either a nasal vowel in the rightmost position in the root or a complex nasal consonant, and with voiceless stops as transparent segments; (2) root final nasal vowels causing local nasalization of the following suffix-initial voiceless stop; (3) the local nasalization of complex nasal consonants triggered by adjacent nasal vowels in the root; (4) a morphophonological rightward LDNH process restricted to the suffixes -py and -ʔi, triggered by an immediatley preceding root-final nasal vowel, so that all undergoers in these suffixes surface as nasal (i.e., they surface as -mɨ̃ and ʔ-ĩ ). 			
Notes:	Thomas includes two tables of segments in Mbyá, one consonantal and one vocalic (p.76-77), where underlying segments and surface allophones are not distinguished, as per the author: "The following tables present the segmental inventory of Mbya. Note that relations of allophony are not represented in the table" (p.76). Some voiced stops and affricates seem to be phonemic in Mbyá, based on Thomas' notation and analysis: "Mbya has one glided voiced stop /gw/, and one voiced affricate, /ʤ/" (p.78). However, the author is unclear as to which segments are phonemic or allophonic. The allophones list has been completed and included to the best of our knowledge, but it should be noted that some allophonic processes might be missing.  "Note that the voiceless fricative /s/ of Mbya seems to be attested only in one word, sapukai (‘to shout’), which may have been borrowed from Paraguayan Guarani" (p.79).

Synthesis:	This synthesis closely follows Thomas' (2014) analysis of Mbyá given that it is the only description for the variety spoken in Argentina. Following Thomas, we consider Mbyá to have contrastive oral and nasal vowels. We adopt the following processes from Thomas: (1) rightward allomorphy selection, nasalization of the locative {-pɨ} and diminutive suffix {-ʔi} to [mɨ̃] and [ʔĩ], respectively, after a root-final nasal vowel. In this process the glottal stop /ʔ/ from the diminutive suffix is not nasalized; (2) leftward LDNH, a root-final stressed nasal vowel spreads its nasalization, nasalizing oral vowels and the voiced segments /ɾ, w, ɡʷ, β, dʒ/. Oral stops /p, t, tʃ, k, kʷ, ʔ/ act as transparent to this process; (3) rightward MPP, in a root-suffix compound a root-final nasal vowel triggers pre-nasalization of oral stops /p, t, k, kʷ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ], respectively.  We diverge from Thomas' analysis in the following ways: (1) we consider nasal consonants to be underlying and undergo a process of post-oralization before an oral vowel, i.e. /m, n, ŋ, ŋʷ/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ, ŋɡʷ], respectively (leftward LO). We infer that this process occurs in prefixes, roots, and suffixes, based on the following data points from Thomas: kũɲã+ŋɡʷe 'woman', õ+mãnõ+mba 'they all died', ɲãnẽ+mbaraka 'our guitar' (p. 84-85).
