Summary:	Wolf addresses two lects of Chiriguano: Ava (including Ava and Ava-Chané) and Izoceño. For Ava (covered in this sheet, it is unclear which processes are active in the Izoceño dialect), Wolf proposes underlying nasal archiphonemes (coded as in double slashes with capital letters, such as //NN//) and nasal vowels. The author assumes the following phonological rules: (1) leftward nasal harmony triggered by the leftmost nasal Ṽ with vowels, nasal archiphonemes, j, and r as undergoers; (2) leftward long distance nasalization triggered by //NN// with //NN// as undergoers and slight nasalization of intervening Vs as a result - is blocked by all other consonants; (3) boundary oralization of V at the end of words, except when following w, j, or other vowels; (4) optional boundary nasalization of /ɾ/ to [nd] at the beginning of words, especially after pause; (5) nasal harmony triggered by the nasal suffixes -ɲo, -rã as opposed to a root-internal trigger; (6) local nasalization of the final V in the root when followed by the nasal suffixes -ramo, -rani, -ma; (7) local syllabic nasalization of the suffix tei and postposition téi after a root final nasal vowel. Also (8) long distance oral harmony is implied by the stated alternations between nasal and oral consonants, since the latter are derived from nasal archiphonemes in the same long distance processes as their nasal counterparts. We are unable to ascertain the exact features of the Izoceño dialect: the prose is not clear on which phonological processes apply to which dialect(s).  			
Notes:	Dietrich describes a "dissasimilation" rule where if a syllable has an ND, the preceding syllable must not have ND (and therefore must have N), but there is no explicit relation of this to any sort of harmony system; it is labeled here, however, as LDNH. The author also mentions 4 names for lects of chiriguano: ava, ava-chané, izoceño, and tapiete, but groups ava and ava-chané in group "A" (with the occasional specification of ava-chané as Ac) and has izoceño as group "B", and the author states that they did little offical work with the fourth dialect tapiete and just briefly encountered the group (and appears to group it with group B, but doesn't seem to have done enough work with them to have anything from B meaningfully apply to tapiete).  Dietrich also describes a series of vowel "neutralizations" and syncope in this dialect (ava/dialect A) that don't exist in izoceno on page 68. Not enough information is given (only a few examples) on the vowel deletion rule to include in allophones. This is all part of a distinction between the two lects where ava is more progressive and izoceno more conservative. Dietrich only lists two nasal archiphonemes, M and N (61), giving two contradictory distributions for the second - one varying between [nd] and [n] in oral and nasal contexts respectively, and the other varying between [ŋɡ] and [ŋ] in the same environments. We interpret this as a typo, and label the second use of the letter <N> as a velar nasal archiphoneme //Ŋ//. This is supported by the preceding prose, where he says "Hay cuatro fonemas consonánticos que tienen variantes combinatorias en la realización concreta" - that is, four phonemes that undergo processes the nasalization/oralization processes, even though he only lists 3 symbols, M N (twice) and J.   Dietrich's understanding of allophones appears to differ from the modern mainstream phonology: he stipulates that "[N]os parece más adecuado decir que el fonema es en cada caso lo que es común en ambas realizaciones (p.61)." It is for the same rationale that he proposes the nasal archiphonemes. While we cannot bring ourselves to agree with the claims, we have coded this reference document to reflect the source.

Summary:	Daviet proposes underlying oral stops (D) and both oral and nasal vowels. The author assumes the following rules regarding nasality: (1) spontaneous nasalization where D become prenasalized ND intervocalically; (2) optional boundary nasalization where D become ND word intially; (3) leftward LDNH triggered by rightmost nasal vowels in the root as well as post-oralized ND, with all voiced consonants and vowels as undergoers; (5) nasal-oral allomorphy with the causative prefix bo- to mɔ̃-  when followed by ND.			
Notes:	This paper was influenced by the author of the Emerillon paper (which is why there's local spontaneous nasalization). Rose was Daviet's MA thesis advisor. It is mentioned on pg 33 that all but one of the informants for this source were speakers of the primary Ava dialect and that the phonological analysis is based on this dialect. For this reason we include this source here with Dietrich's description of the Ava (and Chane) dialect. It is mentioned on pg 90 that the LDNH does not transcend compound boudaries.   The triggers of the LDNH process is either a nasal vowel or a postoralized nasal. Nasal vowels are only contrastive at the end of the morpheme (pg. 89), and ND are predictable allophones of the oral stops. Consequently, the positional restriction is coded as "None".

Synthesis:	We assume five processes that result in nasal-oral alternations: (1) leftward spreading LDNH triggered by nasal vowels and nasal stops, affecting all vowels and sonorants within the root and a potential series of prefixes; (2) LO, whereby /N/ --> [ND] / _V; (3) morphophonological LN, whereby /T/ --> [ND] / mõ+_; (4) Morphophonological syllabic LN whereby 3 specified suffixes (-ramo, -rani, -ma) nasalize the preceding root-final vowel; (5) A morphophonological process whereby two specific suffixes (-ɲo, -rã) initiate LDNH (as opposed to a root-internal trigger).			
Data inputter:	MJL, EK			
Date completed:	2022/8/22			
Notes:	Our analysis differs from that of the original sources in several important ways, so it is worthwhile to justify these differences. Most importantly, we view the alternations between post-oralized and nasal stops as reflecting local oralization of underlyingly nasal stops by neighboring oral vowels (N -> ND / _V). The sources, however, view this alternation as reflective of nasalization of underlying oral or underspecified stops, either through LDNH (Dietrich) or through spontaneous nasalization (Daviet). In our view, the underlying nasal analysis better captures the data, because these segments can also be triggers of nasal harmony, as both sources record (LDNH:ND in Dietrich, LDNH in Daviet). This requires either some sort of spontaneous nasalization of the stop to feed further LDNH, or for nasal features to somehow be inserted, neither of which accord with the facts or with common assumptions in phonological theory. A simpler explanation is that these stops are in fact underlyingly nasal. Thus, they have nasal features from the get go which they can spread leftward through LDNH. The postoralized stops are explained as allomorphs of nasal stops that occur preceding underlying oral vowels when these fail to get nasalized through LDNH by a root nasal vowel.   We are somewhat uncertain about the accuracy of MPP=LDNH:Root as it seems unlikely that two specified suffixes would initiate nasal harmony. It is possible that this is instead an LN or syllabic LN process whereby only the previous vowel is nasalized, however, Dietrich specifically includes examples of this process transcribed to demonstrate long distance nasalization. The alternation between mbo ~ mõ of the causative prefix follows the general pattern of LDNH.
