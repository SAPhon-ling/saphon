Summary:	dos Santos considers two dialects of the Kawahiva language: Karipuna (included here) and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau (addressed in the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau section). This section discusses Karipuna. dos Santos proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive oral and vowels (V, Ṽ) for Karipuna, as well as 3 processes: (1) leftward LDNH, nasal vowel in a root spreads its nasality leftward, nasalizing oral vowels and the glides {w, j} (p.3-4). Voiceless obstruents {T} and {h} are considered transparent while {ɾ, ʔ} block this process; (2) leftward LN, nasal coarticulation on vowels in a root when preceding ND. The author considers [ND] as allophones of N and /kʷ/ that are either in free variation or complementary distribution with N, but does not expand on the environment; (3) rightward MPP, suffixes with initial oral vowels nasalize when the previous root or suffixe ends in a nasal consonant or nasal vowel. The author notes that this process is that this process is "cyclic, occuring each time a new suffix is added to the right edge of the stem" (p.6). Furthermore, dos Santos notes that during this morphophonological alternation, suffixes with more than one oral vowel can appear as fully nasalized, such as in the case of the suffix {-uhu, AUG} which surfaces as {ũhũ}. The author only provides two examples {-uhu, AUG} and {-a, 'determiner'} to show this process, but does include that this process is not just limited to those two suffixes and that "these two suffixes are the best examples, as there are many examples with them" (p.6).  Consonantal allophones are provided in a table but no discussion is included with regards to their environment other than "allophones are in complementary distribution or free variation" (p.2). Based on the data, /a/ seems to have the following nasal allophones: [ã], [ɐ̃], and [ə̃], /o/ has two [õ] and [ɔ̃]. It's clear that nasal consonants have NDs as post-oralized allophones given the input-output mapping and the environment before oral vowels but there is no explanation for it in the prose therefore the environment has been left as NA. [ŋɡʷ] is considered an allophone of /kʷ/ based on the fact that [ŋɡʷ] appears in brackets and the author notes that phones "in brackets are allophones in complementary distribution" (p.2) but there is no further discussion on it. Nasality is contrastive only on stressed syllables (p.8), which is always root final (p.3)					
Notes:	Karipuna [ISO: kuq] is a separate language from Karipuna Creole French [ISO: kmv].   This paper discusses the same process for both Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau. Consequently, the summary presented for this paper is identical for both dialects, as no distinction is specifically made between the linguistic facts of the two dialects in the manuscript.

Summary:	Paper is a word list comparing Karipuna and Jumá. Abrahamson & Abrahamson include a list of "Karipuna phonetics" but do not specify which are phonemes and which are allophones other than voiceless obstruents having aspirated allophones word-finally. Since the section is labeled "phonetics", we can assume that, for the most part, these are just surface phones. The authors seem to propose underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V), but there are no descriptions of harmony processes or contrastive nasal vowels.

Synthesis:	This synthesis closely follows dos Santos' analysis of nasality in Karipuna. Our analysis crucially differs in that we further posit a process of LO, whereby /m, n, ŋ/ --> [mb, nd, ŋɡ] before an oral vowel. Though it is not possible to be certain that this process is really at play, the available transcriptions offered by the author suggest that this is indeed the case. There is one exception to this rule on p.5, table 5 /o-maʔẽ-maʔẽ/ --> [ma’ʔẽ-ma’ʔẽ] ‘wake up’, which remains unaccounted for, suggesting there may be variation with respect to the application of this particular process.
