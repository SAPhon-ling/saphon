Summary:	Soares relies on Bendor-Samuel's (1967) phonemic inventory of Guajajara (p. 88), positing underlying nasal consonants (N) and oral vowels (V). Citing Bendor-Samuel (1966), Soares proposes rightward nasal-oral allomorphy, with certain lexically specified roots triggering this process for the following suffixes: {-puku}, {-pe}, and {-kwer}, in which the initial obstruent of the suffix nasalizes to [m] and [ŋ], resulting in {-muku, -mu, -ŋwer} (p. 90). The author also notes that local nasalization, which still occurs in other Tupi-Guarani languages, does not occur in Gujajajára (p. 91) and discusses the historical processes of Guajajára having lost nasal vowels.					
Notes:	Data from speakers who live near the Mearim, Grajaú, and Pindaré rivers, in the state of Maranhão (p. 8). Cites Bendor-Samuel's phonemic invetory of Guajajara and allophones, as well as nasal-oral allomorphy.

Summary:	Dictionary of Guajajára-Portuguese words which includes a small section on the syntax of Guajajára. Harrison & Harrison include a table of phonemes and orthographic representations in Guajajára (p. 3-4), as well as their respective counterparts in Portuguese orthography. The authors note that "<kw> and <gw> are probably simple phonemes although they are represented with digraphs" (p. 3), therefore these have been included in the segments and allophones sections, and have been coded as [kʷ] and [ŋʷ], respectively. The authors also note that [ᵘ] in Guajajara represents [w], while [ⁱ] represents [j], in which it is an allophone of [z] at the end of a syllable.					
Notes:	There is a small section on syntax, but no description or analysis of harmony processes. / ï / in the source seems to correspond to [ɯ] in IPA - described as high back unrounded.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Bendor-Samuel describes the phonemic inventory of Guajajara, along with its allophones and allophonic processes. Bendor-Samuel proposes one morphological process: (1) Nasal-oral allomorphy is present for certain suffixes that begin with voiceless stops, such as {kwer, pe} (p. 165, 203), which can appear as {ŋweɾ} and {me}. The author includes a description of Guajajara's phonological hierarchy, such as stress and pitch patterns. Bendor-Samuel also notes that [ə] can act as the nucleus of a syllable when the "consonants t, k, m, n, ŋ, and w function as syllable codas" (p. 73 -74) and schwa is followed by a consonant, therefore {t̪ᵊ, kᵊ, mᵊ, nᵊ, ŋᵊ, and wᵊ}, but later includes obstruents and approximants as allophones of Guajajára (p. 108 - 109), so those have been coded as allophones of {t̪, m, n, ŋ, w} with schwa excrescence. [ɾ] and [ɺ] occur in free variation (p. 16), as do [z] and [ʒ] (p. 16), while [ts] is palatalized to [tʃ] when it preceeds a front vowel or mid-front vowel (p. 16, 91-92). The author proposes rightward nasal-oral allomorphy for the following suffixes: {kwer, former} and {pe, to}, which are conditioned by certain lexically specified roots or prefixes (p. 165, 203).

Summary:	Paper is a description of morphological and syntactic processes in Guajajára. There is a short section (p. 19) with a table of phonemes in Guajajára. The table does not include phonemes that appear in free variation or in complementary distribution, as the author notes that "the dissertation does not aim to explain the phenomena linked to the sonority of the language" (p. 19). de Castro also notes the inclusion of the phoneme [s] in the table, opposing Duarte's (2007) analysis, and addresses that the data collected for this research was "mainly from the Guajajára dialect" (p. 19). 					
Notes:	The author considers Tenetehára to be one language, with Guajajára and Tembé being dialects. Given that de Castro claims the data collected was "mainly from the Guajajára dialect" (p. 19), this paper has been coded under Guajajára.

Summary:	da Silva presents Bendor-Samuel's (1972) and Eiró's (2001) phonemic tables for Guajajára and Tembé (p. 85-90), respectively, in which the author groups both languages under the label Tenetehára. da Silva includes their own phonemic description of each language, noting separately when one phoneme appears in Guajajára and another appears in Tembé. There is a short section on nasality, in which da Silva proposes one phonological process: (1) rightward LN, with the right-most nasal of the root triggering 'light nasalization' on vowels (p. 111). The author only presents two examples for this process.					
Notes:	Data collected from speakers who lived in Angico Torto village in Maranhão (p. 65). da Silva cites Bendor-Samuel (1972) - checking the bibliography it seems that this is the same paper as Bendor-Samuel's (1966) Hierarchical structures in Guajajara, coded above.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	This paper addresses the effects language contact between Guajajara speakers and Portuguese has had on Guajajara, such as phonological and semantic borrowings from Portuguese and its effects on second generation speakers of the language. Barboza presents and discusses Bendor-Samuel's (1963, 1972) and Silva's (2010) phonological inventories of Guajajára, but also includes her own table and notes differences in phonemes and allophones as compared to Bendor-Samuel and Silva. The author considers [tʃ] an allophone of /s/ and /t/: /s/ undergoes palatalization before [i] and surfaces as [tʃ] (p. 38), while [tʃ] is an allophone of /t/ before [ɨ] only for "second generation, male speakers of Guajajara" (p. 39); both occurences have been included.					
Notes:	Barboza notes that the Tenetehara "are comprised of two ethnicities, the Tembé in Para and the Guajajara in the state of Maranhão" (p. 15). The author includes that the investigation in this paper was conducted with the Guajajara people, who live in the city of Barro do Corda, Maranhão (p. 15). Barboza also considers the Guajajára language separate from Tembé (p. 16), therefore, this paper is coded in the Guajajára section. Data are from Guajajára speakers who live near Barro do Corda, Maranhão (p. 15), from the villages Taboca 1, Jacu, Jiruti and Colônia (p. 16).

Synthesis:	We mostly base this analysis on Bendor-Samuel's primary analysis, which includes an LN process whereby /T/ --> [N] after some lexically-specified roots, and add some of Silva's proposal for an LN process whereby Vs are nasalized to the right of a nasal consonant.					
Data inputter:	MJL

Notes:	Guajajara lost contrastive nasal vowels, and therefore LDNH. However, the process of /T/ --> [ND] that is common at root-root or root-suffix boundaries in many of the Subgroup I TG languages is observed as a /T/ --> [N] alternation in Guajajara following those roots that had final nasal vowels. Since the nasal vowels are no longer present, the conditioning environment for this process is now lexically-specified by particular roots.   The mrphn process that affects /puku, pe, kwer/ has been described by Soares and Bendor-Samuel as being a morphological process that affects a particular set of morphemes, triggered by a lexically-conditioned set of morphemes. Here, we have chosen to capture the fact that all of the undergoing morphemes have initial labial obstruents, namely /p, kw/, and to list the undergoers of the process as this natural class, within a particular set of morphemes. This captures the tendency observed elsewhere in TG for /p/ and /kw/ initial suffixes (but not /t, tS, k/ initial suffixes) to undergo nasalization.
