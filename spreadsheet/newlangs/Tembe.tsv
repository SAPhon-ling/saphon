Summary:	This source is a dictionary for Tembé. There is a small section of the phonemic inventory of the language (p. 13) but no description of harmony processes. Boudin includes [ʒ], which the author claims is an allophone of /z/ intervocalically (p. 14). The stops /p, t, k/ and /n/ geminate when they appear in the onset of a stressed syllable (p. 14).					
Notes:	No contrastive nasal vowels.

Source:	Orjuela, Lorena & Sérgio Meira. ms. Tembé (Tenetehara).					
Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	The source is a submitted manuscript to JIPA and thus does not have a publication date.  Orjuela & Meira do not propose any harmony processes for Tembé, other than briefly mentioning that there are no phonemic nasal vowels in Tembé and that vowels can be "nasalized by contact" (p. 5) with nasal consonants. Tembé does not have contrastive nasal vowels.   Despite a lack of an explicit proposal by the authors, the data on pages 5-6 and 12-13 suggests two phonological processes in Tembé: (1) rightward LN, triggered by a nasal, nasal with oral explosion, or a pre-oralized nasal, with adjacent vowels becoming nasalized (p. 5-6, 12-13). The authors present examples in the data that point towards this LN process occasionally being bidirectional, rathern than just rightward; it has been grouped into one process (p. 5-6, 12-13); (2) rightward LO, triggered by the leftmost vowel of the root and causing adjacent nasals to become pre-oralized nasals (p. 6). Nasals and nasals with oral explosions are grouped under one category of nasals {N} in the natural classes row. Nasals with oral explosion exist in free variation word-initially and intervocalically - this is reflected in process (3) described as a SO.					
Notes:	No analysis with regards to nasal processes is actually proposed by the authors. Venting seems to be present for some of the data: /daku/ 'bird sp', /dapu/ 'bird sp', and /danu/ 'spider', which can surface with pre-nasalized stops: [ⁿdaku] 'bird sp', [ⁿdapu] 'bird sp', and [ⁿdanu] 'spider' (p. 5) but this analysis is not expanded on. [e̝] indicates a raised form of /e/. Orjuela and Meira consider Tembé and Guajajara co-dialects of the Tenetehara language (p. 2). The authors talk about the merger between /i/ and /ɪ/, showing that the two phonemes overlap significantly in the acoustic space (p. 15-16).  In a /VN/ sequence, the output can be either [VDN] or [ṼN]. This has been coded using the following input-output mappings: {V, {V, Ṽ}, /VN/, {ṼN, VDN}}, {N, {N, DN}, /VN/, {ṼN, VDN}}. It seems that pre-oralization can occur with /m, n, ŋ/, but perhaps not with /ŋʷ/ given the absence of a datapoint with a pre-oralized [gŋʷ]. We also note that, while in our version of Orjuela & Meira's manuscript there is also no datapoint exemplifying pre-oralized /n/ as [dn], Baraúna (2016) cites the following example [ǝkǝpin]~[ǝkǝpidn] ‘pássaro local’ from Orjuela & Meira's manuscript. We suspect that we may have access to a slightly different version of manuscript, as this same datapoint is transcribed as [əkəˈpĩn] in our version. Nonetheless, we infer from this that pre-oralization also applies to alveolar /n/. We also note that while there is no datapoint in the ms. that exemplifies vowel nasalization (LN) triggered by /ŋʷ/, we simply assume that /ŋʷ/ does nasalize adjacent vowels in the same way as other nasal consonants.  We understood "oral explosion" as a postoralization.

Summary:	This summary combines Duarte's 2003 dissertation and 2007 book chapter. The 2003 dissertation presents a syntactic analysis of Tembé with a short section of the phonemic inventory (2003:27-31). The author notes three allophones for /s/: {s, ts, tʃ} and five allophones for /d/: {d, z, dz, dʒ, j} (2003:27). There are no descriptions of harmony processes. Duarte's 2007 analysis presents the same table and data as the 2003 paper, and includes [t] as a phoneme in Tembé (2007:28), which was not included in the 2003 dissertation. There are no contrastive nasal vowels in Tembé.

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Rice proposes underlying nasal consonants and oral vowels, along with 1 morphophonological process for Tembé: (1) rightward MPP, triggered by the causative prefix {mu-} that appears as the leftmost morpheme of the domain, nasalizing adjacent roots that begin with {p} or {k} (p. 110, 126). Rice only presents two examples for this process, the roots {pau, to.finish}, and {kize, to.fear} nasalize to {mau} and {ŋize}, respectively (p. 110, 126).					
Notes:	Rice does not use IPA and includes <g> in the phonemic inventory. It is unclear whether <g> is [ɡ] or [ŋ]. The author also notes that there are no pre-nasalized stops in Tembé (p. 110). Rice does not propose contrastive nasal vowels for Tembé.

Summary:	Eiró proposes one phonological process: (1) leftward LN, triggered by the rightmost nasal in the root. Vowels and the palatal approximant /j/ are undergoers (p. 11, 53-55). There are no transparent or blockers in this process. Eiró posits underlying N but no contrastive nasal vowels.

Synthesis	We mostly adopt Orjuela & Meira's analysis, with some slight differences. The phonemic inventory is taken from O&M (which they mostly adopt from Duarte 2007), and contains no contrastive nasal vowels. Based on data in O&M's Table 2 (p. 5), we assume that venting occurs to word-initial /d/ --> [nd], despite the fact that the authors do not discuss this phonological process. Pre-oralization of word-final /N/ happens after oral vowels--this process seems to be most frequent for word-final Ns. Post-oralization of /N/ before oral vowels also seems to occur sometimes, despite the fact that O&M don't discuss it--this is surprising, as the second spectrogram from Figure 1 clearly shows a post-oralized [mb]. Finally, O&M claim that Tembé exhibits nasals with oral explosion [m͈, n͈] in pre-vocalic position, but the evidence for this is equivocal based on the available spectrograms, where the burst is not nearly as clear as in the orally-exploded nasals observed in Karitiâna (see Demolin, Haude & Storto 2006). It may be that some cases of what they describe as orally-exploded nasals are actually post-oralized nasals, but more data is needed to determine whether or not this is the case. Orjuela & Meira actually seem to have thought the same thing at some point, as the spectrograms on p. 7 show transcriptions with both post-oralized [mb] and circumoralized [bmb] for the word 'collared peccary', which is transcribed in Table on p.6 with oral explosion.  Venting seems to be present for some of the data: /daku/ 'bird sp', /dapu/ 'bird sp', and /danu/ 'spider', which can surface with pre-nasalized stops: [ⁿdaku] 'bird sp', [ⁿdapu] 'bird sp', and [ⁿdanu] 'spider' (p. 5) but this analysis is not expanded on.  In a /VN/ sequence, the output can be either [VDN] or [ṼN]. We believe that the leftward nasalization and the rightward oralization ultimately boil down to the same process that delineates the boundary of the oral/nasal span, and the two surfacing "allophones" are either due to the stochastic differences durnig spontaneous speeches or by the impressionistic judgement of the listener. Consequently, we coded two categorical and not optional processes: LN:L and LO, and notated the resulting allophones in the form of: {V, Ṽ, _N, LN}, {N, DN, V_, LO}. The rightward spread of nasality remains optional.   It seems that pre-oralization can occur with /m, n, ŋ/, but perhaps not with /ŋʷ/ given the absence of a datapoint with a pre-oralized [gŋʷ]. We also note that, while in our version of Orjuela & Meira's ms. there is also no datapoint exemplifying pre-oralized /n/ as [dn], Baraúna (2016) cites the following example [ǝkǝpin]~[ǝkǝpidn] ‘pássaro local’ from Orjuela & Meira's manuscript. We suspect that we may have access to a slightly different version of manuscript, as this same datapoint is transcribed as [əkəˈpĩn] in our version. Nonetheless, we infer from this that pre-oralization also applies to alveolar /n/. We also note that while there is no datapoint in the ms. that exemplifies vowel nasalization (LN) triggered by /ŋʷ/, we simply assume that /ŋʷ/ does nasalize adjacent vowels in the same way as other nasal consonants. For instances of LN initiated by /ŋ, ŋʷ/, we code them as categorical in the allophone tuples, but we postulate that sometimes the nasalization is too weak to be perceptible, hence the remark of it being optional by some authors.

Notes:	Oral explosion may be an enhancement mechanism, where creating a burst at the CV transition between a nasal consonant and a nasal vowel helps with creating a clear perceptual boundary between the two segments types, just as in the case of oral TV transitions. Because it is not unequivocally a case of nasal-oral alternation, it has not been coded as a process below, but does appear in the allophones section.
