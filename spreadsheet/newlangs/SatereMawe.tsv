Summary:	The source proposes an underlying oral-nasal contrasts in both the stops (/p t k/ vs. /m n ŋ/ respectively) and the short vowels (/ɨ i e a o u/ vs. /ĩ ẽ ã ũ/ respectively), while not claiming any such contrast in the long vowels /ɨː iː eː aː uː/; she does not posit the existence of */ɨ̃ õ oː/ due to the lack of evidence, and the fact that the surface [ɨ̃ õ] are in complementary distribution with their oral counterparts. She posits 1) an LN process where m nasalizes preceding/ɨ/ in word-final stressed syllables and 2) an LN process where ŋ nasalies proceedinɡ /o/ in word-final stressed syllables to account for these facts. She also postulates 3) a process of rightward LN, where nasal vowels condition underlying voiceless stops to their right to surface as prenasalized voiced stops, even when crossing word boundaries, 4) a process we have hesitantly labeled LN where word-final voiceless stops nasalize preceding an [h] at the beginning of the following word; this may be a kind of 'rhinoglottophilia', or the /h/ in question may be articulatorily and/or acoustically nasalized while still escaping impressionistic detection, making it a true LN process, and finally 5) a leftward LN process where nasal vowels nasalize preceding /j/ to [ɲ].					
Notes:	Though the source only explicitly describes /o/ nasalizing before /ŋ/ as coded in LN:o, there is an example of it nasalizing before word-final /m/, though apparently in a non stressed syllable: /som/ 'DUB' --> [sõm] (ex. 41c, pp. 101-102). The converse (ɨ nasalizing before ŋ contra LN:ibar) does not seem to be attested, see e.g. [iãʔɨŋkɨtʔi], Narrative 06 line 2 pp. 348)  All examples of LN:ibar and LN:o in the source are root-internal, though this is certainly only due to the coincidental lack of suffixes ending in /ɨm/ or /oŋ/; the source does not comment on this apparent pattern.  Da Silva interprets [mb nd ŋɡ] as the result of prenasalization of underlying /p t k/. The alternative treatment of these phones as the result of postoralization is not examined, though on the face both treatments could explain the observed complimentary distribution (87) of the series [mb nd ŋɡ], [p t k] and [m n ŋ] (87). This complimentarity may be because prenasalization generally applies after a nasal vowel and before an oral vowel. This distribution is not claimed explicitly by da Silva (2010), and I could not find any data proving or falsifying this. Drude (2008:252) claims that ṼNTṼ sequences are attested, but we do not dispose of the data that may have motivated this claim. So the postoralization analysis would seem tenable, until we consider that prenasalization can cross word boundaries in otherwise the same environment as hypothesized word-internally (ex. 51e, Silva 2010:102), and that the targets for such processes are clearly underlying voiceless stops. This fact makes it more economical to posit a single prenasalization process to which word boundaries are transparent.  The process of vowel lenɡtheninɡ in word-final closed syllables interacts with an undescribed process of local nasalization evident in the data, whereby vowels nasalize immediately precedinɡ nasal stops (e.ɡ. /en/ → [ˈẽːn̥] ‘você’, ex. 32e pp. 94). However, since this latter process is not described in the source, we exclude nasality from the lengthening rule, despite it being at odds with the data. Another undescribed but evident process is nasal place assimilation across word boundaries: word-final nasal stops assimilate to following word-initial oral stops in place, for example /hun kahato/ --> [hũŋɡahatɔ] ‘o cabelo dele é preto’ (ex. 40b pp. 101).  The author gives examples of a pre-vocalic voicing rule at word boundaries (99-100), but some of these examples are actually at word-internal morpheme boundaries (39e-f) and one is even root-internal (39d). They also note that glottal stops are transparent to the process; the glottal stop is deleted in some of the examples (39d-e). The voicing rule is described as follows: "Em fronteira de palavras, é comum o processo de vozeamento dos segmentos oclusivos [p], [t] e [k] diante de segmentos vocálicos" (99). All the examples given involve underlying coda stops occuring after a vowel and before another vowel, sometimes with an "transparent" glottal stop in between (100). The process was coded here with the simplified environment da Silva gives, but was updated according to our understanding based on the data in the synthesis.  The author briefly notes the following regarding vowel nasalization "Em Sateré-Mawé, as vogais nasais ocorrem mais frequentemente em sílaba tônica final de palavras. Vogais orais que as antecedem se realizam como nasalizadas em maior ou menor grau, dependendo da proximidade da vogal nasal." (p. 93). While this claim suggests that LDNH can occur in Sateré-Mawé, no explicit analysis is proposed by the author or discussed later in the manuscript. Given this fact, this process has been excluded.

Source:	Drude, Sebastian. 2008. Nasal harmony in Awetí and the Mawetí-Guaraní family (Tupí).  Amerindia 32.					
Data inputter:	Jasper Talwani					
Summary:	Based on data (almost none of which is given in the source) from Sergio Meira's unpublished field notes, Drude compares nasal harmony in Satere-Mawe to its close relatives Awetí and Proto-Tupi-Guaraní, finding the facts to be very similar. As in Aweti, he postulates an underlying three-way contrast between oral vowels /a e i o u ɨ/ and their underlyingly nasal and "neutral" (neither nasal nor oral, notated here in double slashes) counterparts. Many of the facts have been inferred; for instance, the same 6-way vowel contrast stated for the nasal vowels is inferred in the neutral vowels and oral vowels. He similarly posits a three-way contrasts between voiceless stops /p t k/, nasal stops /m n ŋ/, and stop archiphonemes (notated here in double slashes) due to their different distributional behavior. 1) due to an LN process, stop archiphonemes (which are confined to root-final context) are realized as nasal stops folloing nasal vowels, but as oral after oral vowels, making these realizations in complementary distribution. The unreleased stops are "among their oral variants", and these were coded as the default realization since not enough information was given to construct a precise environment for this process. 2) Another LN process prenasalizes voiceless stops following nasal vowels. 3) There is also a LDNH process he describes as working "one segment at a time" iteratively until it hits a) a voiceless stop or b) the left edge of the word, with neutral vowels, glides, liquids, and fricatives being the target. It is possible that glottals (/h/, /ʔ/) are considered transparent to LDNH, e.g. n. 24 pp. 260. Only classes/segments explicitly described and listed are coded, except for /j/ (whose behavior was clear from some data) making the characterization below certainly incomplete.The processes as coded here are certainly incomplete due to the lack of data and specificity, and we have tried to make clear where a claim is an interpretation and where it properly can be attributed to Drude. 					
Notes:	Source gives no data justifying their analysis. Also, the inventory has been derived partially by explicit mentioning of existing segments, partially by implication from statements suggesting that the facts are the same as the related language Aweti analyzed in the paper; the inventory given here is therefore possibly incomplete.  The environment for LDNH given in allophones section reflects the fact that Drude sees nasal harmony in Satere-Mawe as operating iteratively one segment at a time; this does not however make it local nasalization as this process can apply multiple times, making the actual trigger potentially distant from the target, assuming no opaque segments intervene. Also, the true environment would probably include the "glides, liquids, and fricatives" which are never enumerated as possible segments to the right of the "target"; these have been omitted due to the uncertainty as to which segments Drude includes in these natural classes.  Drude considers "glides, liquids or fricatives" (p. 251, 253) as undergoers of LDNH. However the lack of a clear phonemic inventory prevents us from being able to fully represent it and include them in the LDNH process and allophones sections below. Given data points such as /jũkãK/ [ɲũŋkãŋ] 'toucan' and /ejãP/ [ɛ̃ɲãm] 'village/place' (p. 260, footnote 24), we assume that /j/ is an underlying phoneme in Mawé and that it undergoes nasalization of /j/ to [ɲ] and therefore have included as such below. In the same line of reasoning we also consider /h/ and /ʔ/ to be phonemes in Mawé based on the following datapoints, respectively: /piehã/ 'toe', /ʔãpi/ 'mouse', /ʔakãK/ [ʔakãŋ] 'head', (p. 260, footnote 24). Considering the close relation between Awetí and Mawé, we assume that the liquid in Mawé is most likely /l/ (given such an occurrence in Awetí) but due to the lack of an explicit proposal by the author we have excluded it from the phonemic inventory.  Regarding glottal consonants, Drude notes the following: "The behaviour of the glottal consonants as well as that of the fricatives in Mawé has to be verified. Possibly only sonorant consonants may be nasalized in Mawé" (p. 251, footnote 13); no further analysis is proposed nor discussed.					
Include in SAPhon:	No	Reason: There are a lot of missing details about the relevant phonological generalizations that makes coding this source very difficult; we retain the basic insight that there is LDNH and the claims about opaque segments in the summary, where we cite Drude (2008).

Summary:	Graham & Graham describe a two-way nasal-oral contrast in the stops between /p t k/ and /m n ŋ/ and between /a e i o u ɨ/ and /ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ ɨ̃/ respectively. They describe several nasalization processes, some of which are not quite described in those terms. 1) rightward LN where /p t k/ are voiced and prenasalized following nasal vowels; 2) bidirectional LN where vowels are also nasalized to a 'weak' degree before or after nasal consonants, compared to the strong nasalization of true nasal vowels. They also describe "morphophonemic" processes occurring within the confines of a prosodic unit they term the "grupo de intensidade" of some 2-5 syllables, whether or not morpheme or word boundaries intervene. When consonants come into contact across these boundaries and within the "grupo de intensidade", several processes occur: 3) rightward LN where /w/ becomes a nasal stop following nasal consonants /m n ŋ/ and assimilates to them in place of articulation, coded as two processes below; 4) rightward LN where, after nasal consonants, /p t/ retain their place but nasalize; 5) leftward LN where morpheme (or word?)-final stops /p t/ nasalize when preceding /m n ŋ h w/. Additionally, they note that sequences of vowels, even when interrupted by /ʔ/, are either all oral or all nasal. As Graham & Grahama they did not describe this as nasal harmony or nasal spreading, we have not coded it as such in our summary of this source, but in conjunction with Drude's (2008) generalizations, discussed in the synthesis for this language, we ultimately treat Mawe as exhibiting LDNH.					
Notes:	In some situations the notation has been updated to reflect more current usage. For instance, the authors transcribe the optional allophone of /w/ when it has 'fricção soprada' (221) as [w̟]; based on this description, we infer that the sound is a bilabial fricative [β] and transcribe it as such. Also, the prenasalized velar stop has been transcribed as [ŋɡ] instead of their [ng]. Finally, the palatal glide has been transcribed as [j] instead of [y].  Graham and Graham include /w/ among the 'fricativas' with /s/ and /h/, but we have grouped it with the sonorants based on transcription.  The LN:finalptbeforew process received a separate block for the environment of /w/ due to the following statement: "antes de consoante nasal ou h, e às vezes antes de w, p torna-se m, e t torna-se n". We took the phrase "às vezes antes de w" to ambiguously mean either that the process is optional in this environment, or that this process happens only "sometimes" (i.e., it is rare and they dispose of little data, even though this data may support categoricality). Given this ambiguity we conservatively coded the process in a separate block and coded it as Uncertain for optionality.  There are a series of apparently 'morphophonological' rules which are limited to within a prosodic unit of 2-5 syllables they call the 'grupo de intensidade'. It appears that these processes can cross word boundaries or intra-word morpheme boundaries, but it is not entirely clear from the description, so we have written them with the morpheme boundary symbol '+' which here covers both environments.

Synthesis:	We mainly adopt da Silva's (2010) analysis, since it is both the most recent study, as well as being in many respects the most thorough one. We additionally draw information from Graham & Graham (1978), which is likewise relatively detailed, and from Drude (2008), the basic insight about the existence of LDNH processes in the language. From these sources, we conclude that Sateré-Mawé has 3 underlying nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/, and a 3-way contrast between oral, nasal, and long oral vowels. The existence of long oral vowels is supported by da Silva (2010), Franceschini (1999), and Pacheco (2010), although it is not mentioned in Graham & Graham (1978).  Our analysis differs from da Silva in a number of ways: (1) We adopt Graham & Graham's (1978:222) proposal that there exists a process of bidirectional LN which weakly nasalizes all oral vowels, in contrast to the da Silva's (2010) claim that only /ɨ/ and /o/ nasalize in quite restricted consonantal environments; and (2) we posit that the language exhibits leftward LDNH as described below, as Drude (2008) explicitly claims, and consistent with Graham & Graham's (1978:222) observations about the distribution of nasal vowel sequences, as well as potentially combatible with some informal observations about the nasality of underlying oral vowels by da Silva (2010:93). We consider the glottals /ʔ, h/ to be transparent in this process based on the following claim from Drude (2008) "glottal segments are not affected by and transparent to NH." (p. 255) and that /p, t, k/ block this process as noted by Drude "the plosives /p, t, k/ are not transparent to NH from the right" (p. 251). We exclude /w/ from undergoing LDNH based on the following data point from Drude: /iwihĩT/ [ĩwĩhĩn] 'cloud' (p. 260) which shows nasalization of oral vowels to the left of an inherently nasal vowel but does not trigger the nasalization of /w/ to [w̃]. We feel some doubt about the accuracy of this latter generalization, however, and note that this is an obvious question for future research.  Based on joint consideration of da Silva (2010) and Graham & Graham (1978) we identify the following additional processes: (1) rightward LN, pre-nasalization of root-internal /p, t, k/ to [mb, nd, ŋɡ] following a nasal vowel and (2) leftward LN, nasalization of morpheme-final /p, t, k/ and devoicing, resulting in the surfacing of [m̥, n̥, ŋ̊], respectively before the following morpheme-initial nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/ or /h, w/. This process is adapted from Graham & Graham's (1978) original proposal of morpheme-final /p, t/ nasalizing to [m, n] before the above environments and da Silva's (2010) proposal of /p, t, k/ nasalizing to [m̥, n̥, ŋ̊] morpheme-finally before a morpheme-initial [h].  Note that we treat the intervocalic voicing process affecting /p, t, k/ that da Silva (2010) describes as only occurring at word boundaries as also happening word-internally on the basis of phonetic transcriptions given on p.100. Da Silva explicitly describes glottal stops as being "transparent" to this intervocalic voicing process such that V_ʔV functions as an "intervocalic" environment for this voicing process. It is also worth noting that da Silva's transcriptions indicate that glottal stops that she posits in underlying forms often do not surface, suggesting further complexities regarding this segment that remain unclear. Note that we have not coded this glottal stop deletion process.

Notes:	Further investigation is also necessary to determine whether /w, ɾ/ can also undergo LDNH, given the claim by Drude (2008) that "the glides, the liquids and the fricatives" (p.251) undergo nasalization. The dearth of data and discussion in this source prevents us from reaching a conclusion on this point.  da Silva (2010:102) only provides two examples of prenasalization crossing a word boundary with /t/ and /p/ (ex. 41e and 42d respectively) , but from context it does not appear she is claiming that it is restricted to those segments. Since /p t k/ form a natural class with respect to their nasality behavior elsewhere, we extrapolated that /p t k/ would prenasalize despite an intervening word boundary in and reflected this in the coding of the process LN:TtoND.
