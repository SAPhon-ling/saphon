Summary:	This summary combines Abrahamson and Abrahamson's 1980 and 1984 analyses, given their similarity. The 1984 paper is a translation into Portuguese done by Eunice Burgess. Abrahamson & Abrahamson posit underlying N and contrastive nasal vowels, as well as one voiced stop for Júma and 5 phonological processes: (1) leftward LO, N post-oralizes before an oral vowel. The authors consider these allophones to be "pre-nasalized plosives" (1984:3) and proposes that this process is one of local nasalization. Given the oral vowel environment, it is most likely that this process is one that results in post-oralized allophones and that this is a local oralization process as opposed to one of LN, and therefore has been included as such; (2) rightward LO, shielding of /N/ to [DN] in syllable codas following an oral vowel (1984:3). The authors also describe these allophones as "post-nasalized plosives" but this seems to be a local oralization process; (3) leftward LN, /j/ nasalizes to [ɲ] preceding a nasal vowel (1984:4); (4) leftward LN, underlying N or their pre-nasalized ND allophones nasalize preceding vowels (1984:10); (5) leftward LN, the past suffix {-mɨ̃} and the future suffix {-nɛ̃hɛ} nasalize the final oral vowel of the preceding morpheme (1980:22). The nasalization of the morpheme-final oral vowel does not trigger the de-post-oralization of the preceding ND to N, such as in [ɔ̃mõmbɨ̃nɛ̃hɛ] 'will fasten' (1980:22). Nasal vowels can contrast in any position in the word, unlike most TG languages.

Synthesis:	We follow Abrahamson & Abrahamson in positing full underlying nasal stops that post-oralize in all position of the words when followed by oral vowels. Nasal consonants pre-oralize after an oral vowel, but only in root-dinal position, e.g. [pirarubm] 'fish eggs' p. 8; pre-oralized consonants are not observed elsewhere in the word. Under our analysis, this latter pattern is due to the fact that vowels in the final syllable of roots/morphemes exhibit absolute faithfulness. This means that these final vowels when underlying oral, do not nasalize, even when followed by a root-final underlying nasal consonant. Instead, such vowels remain oral and pre-oralize the final nasal consonant. The language exhibits a phonemic /g/, which can appear adjacent to oral and nasal vowels without affecting them, e.g. [gãmãipó] 'he delayed much'(p. 5). We adopt Abrahamson's LN proposal that the suffixes {-mɨ̃, -nɛ̃he} nasalize the final oral vowel of the preceding morpheme (1980:22) but posit that they don't trigger the de-post-oralization of [ND], e.g. [ɔ̃mõmbɨ̃nɛ̃hɛ].  Sequences of the type [N... ND], [N ... N], [ND ... DN] are common in the data, but sequences of the type  [ND ... N], which are otherwise unattested in TG are observed in a few examples (1984, p.9). We have doubts about these data, as did the editor/translator of the paper, who specifically remarks upon them as unusual, unexplained, and inconsistent with the rest of Abrahamson & Abrahamson's analysis. Sequences of the type [ND ... ND], [ND ... Ṽ] (with the exception of the structures derived by the presence of the above-noted suffixes), [DN ... ND], and [DN ... N] are not attested at all. With these caveats then, fully nasal and post-oralized nasals are in complementary distribution in the data: [N] occurs before nasal vowels, whereas [ND] occurs before oral vowels. Based on these facts, we infer that Júma exhibits a restricted process of nasal harmony, which spreads leftward from a root-final nasal vowel through /V, w, j/. The data is sufficiently inconsistent that it is not possible for us to reach reliable conclusions regarding which segments are blockers and which are transparent, and whether prefix-root boundaries are likewise opaque or transparent.

Notes:	It is unclear whether nasal vowels can be contrastive in all positions inside the word, but it seems that they don't.
