Summary:	Costa proposes underlying ND at the labial and alveolar positions and phonemic nasal vowels. Two nasal harmony processes (more detailed in the UNICAMP source "Nhandewa Aywu") and an MPP process resulting in velar nasals are proposed: (1) Leftward LDNH triggered by nasal consonant, ND, nasalizing all voiced segments; (2) Bidirectional LDNH nasalizing all voiced segments, triggered by a stressed nasal vowel (only found root-finally); (3) Rightward XMP by which morpheme-initial /k, ɰ/ and /kʷ/ are nasalized to [ŋɡ] and [ŋɡʷ], respectively, after morpheme-final Ṽ. In the general nasal harmony process, k and kʷ are transparent rather than undergoers, making this a morphophonological process; 				
Notes:	Costa describes nasal harmony (when not initiated by a nasal consonant) as being triggered by a nasal autosegment attached to a stressed vowel which is a vestige of a nasal consonant coda that has since been deleted. It is also noted that harmony may spread beyond word boundaries. An "accent group" is defined to be a root and its unstressed affixes.

Summary:	Costa largely is consistent with the 2003 analysis, with a few extra details, especially concerning morphophonological nasalization. Proposed underlying phonemes are still the same: underlying ND and nasal vowels. 3 processes are proposed: (1) leftward LDNH spreading from ND and nasalizing all voiced segments, with transparent voiceless segments; (2) bidirectional LDNH originating from a phonemic nasal vowel (which occurs in a stressed syllable, which only occurs root-finally); (3) morphophonological local nasalization in which a morpheme-final nasal vowel pre-nasalizes a voiceless obstruent to its right when followed by a stressed oral vowel.				
Notes:	This analysis explicitly broadens the morphophonological nasalization process to affect voiceless obstruents - the 2003 analysis did not present a very clear picture of this process or which segments are its undergoers. This source also makes it clear that this process is only relevant when speaking of undergoers within morphemes carrying oral stress - otherwise the bidirectional LDNH would be in effect instead.

Synthesis:	Nhandeva exhibits the following processes involved nasal-oral alternations: 1) leftward LDNH originating from a nasal stop or a root final nasal vowel, affecting all sonorant segments; 2)Leftward LO by which /m, n/ are postoralized preceding an oral vowel; 3) A morphophonological process by which suffix-initial voiceless obstruents are realized as post-oralized nasals after a root-final nasal vowel; 4) a morphophonological process by which stressless suffixes are realized as nasal after a root-final nasal vowel.

Notes:	The description by Costa is at times rather opaque. There seems to be some strange restrictions on voiced velar stops, namely [g, gw, ŋ, ŋɡ, ŋɡw], where these may be realized phonetically as approximants [w, ɰ]. The exact relationship between the two is not particularly clear, but the post-oralized velar consonants seem to only appear as outputs of the LN rule that operates on /T/ at morpheme boundaries. The status of [g, gw] specifically, whether phonemic or allophonic, is not clear at all, but at least they seem to be restricted, unsurprisingly, to oral environments.
