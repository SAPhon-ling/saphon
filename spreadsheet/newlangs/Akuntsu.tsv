Summary:	Aragon proposes underlying nasal consonants (N) and contrastive oral-nasal vowels (V, Ṽ) for Akuntsú and 3 local phonological processes: (1) leftward LN, variable nasalization of /j/ to [j̃] ~ [ɲ] in syllable onsets before a nasal vowel (p. 60); (2) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of oral vowels before or after a nasal consonant (p. 66-69); (3) leftward LN, optional nasalization of /a/ to [ã] ~ [ɔ̃] preceding a nasal consonant in a pre-tonic syllable (p. 68).					
Notes:	According to the author, there are only 6 speakers of Akuntsú: "Os dados que fundamentaram este estudo foram coletados entre 2004 e 2007, na Terra Indígena Rio Omerê (Rondônia), onde vivem os seis remanescentes Akuntsú" (p. 2).   Long vowels were only observed in the following data points: [dɔkiːˈɾap̚] 'macaco prego', [ɛ̰ːp̚] 'folha', [buːt̚] 'antiguo/velho', [ɡaːˈɾu] 'colar', [dʒaɨːˈɾɛ] 'beija-flor', [ɨˈtɨː] 'veado' (p. 46); the author notes "Com relação as vogais longas, constatou-se que existem na língua, porém até o presente momento não foi possível tirar uma conclusão precisa a respeito das condições de sua occurência" ("Regarding long vowels, they have been found to exist in the language, but at the moment it is not possible to derive a precise conclusion with respect to the conditions of their occurence", p. 81).  Aragon proposes laryngealized vowels occur following a glottal stop but also notes that "vogais laringalizadas ocorrem também em outros ambientes" ("laryngealized vowels occur in other environments", p.47) which might suggest that Akuntsú has contrastive laryngealized vowels (similar to Picanço's (2005) proposal for Mundurukú). The following data points from Aragon are proposed for laryngealized vowels that occur in other environments: [ḭpɛbṵ] 'perna delte', [ɔ̰ɾ̰ɔ̰dḭta̰] 'bicho-preguiça', [ɛ̰ːp] 'folha', [ɔ̰ɾɔ̰gʷḭ] 'amendoim', [kɨ̰bɛ̰ɡ̊̚] 'mamão' (p. 47) and /apara kɨ/ [a̰ba̰ɾa̰'kɨ̰] ~ [a̰ba̰ɾa̰'kɯ̰] 'líquido de banana' (p. 67). Given that no further analysis is proposed, we assume that laryngealized vowels are allophones of their oral and nasal counterparts.  We assume oral vowels to undergo optional nasalization as opposed to obligatory nasalization. There are inconsistencies within Aragon's transcriptions, with some data showing completely nasalized vowels while others are completely oral. The only clear statement addressing vowel nasalization is that they occur "em ambientes nasais" ("in nasal environments", p. 66-69). We base this assumption on the following data points: /iamina/ [ia'mĩnã] 'joelho dele', /ameko/ [amɛ̃'ɡu] ~ [ɔ̃mɛ̃'ɡu] 'onça' (p. 66, 68).

Data inputter:	Sebastian Clendenning-Jimenez					
Summary:	Aragon proposes underlying nasal consonants (N), voiced obstruents (D), and contrastive oral and nasal vowels (V/Ṽ) for Akuntsú along with 5 phonological processes: (1) bidirectional LN, optional nasalization of oral vowels, /w/ to [w̃] and /j/ to [j̃] ~ [ɲ] before or after a nasal consonant (p. 45); (2) leftward LDNH, right-most nasal vowel triggers nasalization of approximants and oral vowels to its left (p.48-49). This process is blocked by any obstruent; (3) rightward BN, nasalization of /b/ to [m] root-initially; (4) leftward LN, nasalization of /b/ to [m] before a nasal vowel; (5) leftward LN, a multi-step process composed of 3 parts: 1) intervocalic voicing of /t/ to [d], 2) lenition of [d] to [ɾ], 3) nasalization of [ɾ] to [n] preceding a nasal vowel (p. 76-77).					
Notes:	Aragon notes the following for the low vowel /e/: "/e/ tends to be lower than /o/, with /e/ more closely related to the position of open mid vowels. One might argue that this vowel could be represented as /ɛ/ due to its lower position in the vocalic space; however, I will continue to represent it as /e/ to be consistent with the phonemes proposed for most of the Tuparían languages." (p. 38); given this reasoning we have chosen to represt the vowel as /e/ and not /ɛ/.  We assume that bidirectional is optional in Akuntsú based on the following claim from Aragon: "That is, in unstressed syllables, vowels tend to become nasalized (showing up on the surface as phonetic nasal vowels) as a result of progressive or regressive assimilation when adjacent to a [+nasal] segment, either a nasal consonant or a nasal vowel. Vowels that are underlyingly oral in stressed position adjacent by a nasal segment do not become nasalized through the spreading of the [+nasal] feature of the adjacent nasal segment" (p. 45). The following data transcribed by Aragon seems to support this assumption: /ameko/ [ɔ.mɛ̃ŋ.'ku] ~ [ɔ.mɛ̃.'ku] 'jaguar', /peniket/ [pe.nĩŋ.'kʲɛt̚] ~ [pe.nĩ.kʲɛt̚] 'ladybug (sp.)', /o=ø-mepit/ [o.mɛ̃m.'bit̚] ~ [omɛ̃.'bit̚] 'my son' (p. 46).

Summary:	Paper is an acoustic analysis of obstruents in Akuntsú; no analysis of nasal harmony is discussed. Aragon proposes underlying nasal consonants and contrastive nasal vowels for Akuntsú. Voiceless obstruents become optionally voiced in unstressed syllables and geminate intervocalically in a stressed syllable onset (p. 12-13).					
Notes:	Manuscript is a working paper. Phonemic inventory cited from Aragon (2008). /ɨ̃/ is not considered phonemic by the author, who notes the following: "The high central nasal vowel is not phonemically contrastive in Akuntsú; at least no phonological evidence has been found so far to consider this vowel as part of the vocalic inventory. It might be that nasality leads to a neutralization of the front and central high vowels" (p. 2, footnote 5).

Synthesis:	We adopt Aragon's (2014) analysis of Akuntsú. Following this analysis, Akuntsú presents a series of 3 nasal consonants /m, n, ŋ/ that contrast with voiced obstruents /b, d, ɡ/ as well as five vowels which contrast in their oral and nasal qualities.   We assume five phonological processes: (1) rightward LDNH, the right-most nasal vowel of a root triggers optional nasalization of oral vowels and /ɾ, w, j/. This process is blocked by any obstruent (T - voiceless obstruent, D - voiced obstruent); (2) bidirectional LN, in an unstressed syllable oral vowels and /w, j/ optionall nasalize before or after a nasal consonant or nasal vowel; (3) rightward BN, nasalization of /b/ to [m] root-initially; (4) leftward LN, nasalization of /b/ to [m] before a nasal vowel; (5) leftward LN, morpheme-final /t/ nasalizes to [n] before a morpheme-initial nasal vowel.  We consider leftward LDNH and bidirectional LN to be optional in Akuntsú, based on the following facts: (1) transcriptions of the same word show both forms where all targets of LDNH surface as nasal and ones in which only some of the targets surface as as nasal, e.g. for LDNH,  /aɾamĩra/ [a.ɾa.'mĩɾ̃ɐ̃] ~ [ɐ̃.nɐ̃.'mĩɾ̃ɐ̃] 'woman', /kɨrẽ/ [kɨ.ɾ̃ẽ] ~ [kə̃.nɛ̃] 'today' (Aragon, 2014:48), and for LN, /ameko/ [ɔ.mɛ̃ŋ.'ku] ~ [ɔ.mɛ̃.'ku] 'jaguar', /peniket/ [pe.nĩŋ.'kʲɛt̚] ~ [pe.nĩ.kʲɛt̚] 'ladybug (sp.)', /o=ø-mepit/ [o.mɛ̃m.'bit̚] ~ [omɛ̃.'bit̚] 'my son' (Aragon, 2014:46); (2) the phrasing in Aragon's analysis suggests that such processes are not obligatory in Akuntsú: "In Akuntsú, for example, sonorants are most likely to have the nasality spread to them, as they can also be affected by nasality; obstruents tend to block any tentative spreading of the [+nasal] feature to the preceding vowel, though stops may be affected by nasality" (Aragon, 2014:48) and "That is, in unstressed syllables, vowels tend to become nasalized (showing up on the surface as phonetic nasal vowels) as a result of progressive or regressive assimilation when adjacent to a [+nasal] segment, either a nasal consonant or a nasal vowel. Vowels that are underlyingly oral in stressed position adjacent by a nasal segment do not become nasalized through the spreading of the [+nasal] feature of the adjacent nasal segment" (Aragon, 2014:45).  Following Aragon we assume that laryngealized oral and nasal vowels are stress-conditioned, only occuring when they appear in a stressed syllable.   We interpret Aragon as saying that the vowel lengthening processess, which occurs in stressed syllables, is optional, based on the following observation: "On the basis of these findings, vowels in stressed syllables tend to have longer duration than those in non-stressed syllables" (p. 57). We also interpret the phenomenon captured by the following rule ∅ → C[+long]/VC_V́ to be consonant lengthening in an intervocalic environment, rather than epenthesis.
